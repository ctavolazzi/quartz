## Garden Philosophy

This digital garden is both a personal knowledge management system and a public learning space. Unlike traditional blogs, it's:

- **Living**: Notes are continuously updated and refined
- **Interconnected**: Ideas link to each other naturally
- **Growth-oriented**: Embraces work-in-progress thinking

Feel free to wander, explore connections, and watch ideas evolve over time.
