>Let's just do it. fuck it

HELL YES! This is the energy we need! 

Let's do this right now:

1. Pick your topic - first thing that comes to mind about tech that got you excited recently. No second-guessing.

2. Grab your coffee of choice - whatever you're drinking right now is perfect.

3. Basic structure (but don't overthink it):
- "Hey, I'm Chris and this is NovaBrew. I'm drinking [whatever's in your cup] and today I want to talk about [thing that excites you]"
- Then just... talk about it. Like you're explaining it to a friend.
- End with "Thanks for hanging out - see you next time"

That's it. Seriously. Just hit record and start talking.

Remember:
- This isn't your best episode - it's your first episode
- You already know enough
- Your authentic excitement is what matters
- Done is better than perfect

Want to bounce the topic off me real quick and then just go for it? No more planning - just action.

What's got you fired up about tech lately? Let's use that.
