# The Beardless Three
*Guild Masters Affected by the [[Fartbucket-Tavern-Incident]]*

## Overview
Three prominent members of the [[Guild Masters]] who were forced to shave their beards due to persistent magical sparkles following the [[Giggling Geode]] incident.

## The Members
1. **[[Thorgrim Goldbeard]]** (formerly)
   - Head of the Brewers' Guild Testing Committee
   - First to approve [[Fartbucket]]'s experiment
   - Beard now regrown but occasionally sparkles during full moons

2. **[[Daina Silverbeard]]** (formerly)
   - Chief of Magical Safety Protocols
   - Ironically wrote the pre-incident safety guidelines
   - Used the opportunity to establish new containment procedures

3. **[[Baldin Copperbeard]]** (formerly)
   - Master of Apprentice Oversight
   - Actually enjoyed the sparkles but shaved in solidarity
   - Now requires triple safety checks for all experiments

## Cultural Impact
- Created the "Beardless Brotherhood" support group
- Inspired new magical containment protocols
- Annual "Clean Shave" fundraiser for brewing safety
- Subject of several popular tavern songs

## Legacy
The incident led to the creation of the "Beardless Clause" in all experimental brewing permits, requiring proper magical containment to prevent beard-related incidents.
