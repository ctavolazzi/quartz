## Backstory
A skilled dwarven brewer who discovered that combining his brewing expertise with artificer magic led to... explosive results. Earned the nickname "Fartbucket" after a particularly volatile experimental brew caused an entire tavern to be evacuated due to noxious fumes. Now travels the realm seeking new ingredients and pushing the boundaries of what's possible (and advisable) in brewing.

## Notable Quotes
> "It's not an explosion, it's an unplanned rapid fermentation!"

> "The smell means it's working!"

> "By my beard, that batch was stronger than expected..."

## Current Goals
1. Perfect the "Belching Brew" potion
2. Find rare ingredients for experimental elixirs
3. Prove that brewing and artificer magic are a legitimate combination
4. Replicate the Giggling Geode recipe (but with better containment)
