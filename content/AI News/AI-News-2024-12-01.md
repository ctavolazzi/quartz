## pt 2: Diving into the Article

Let's look at some of Gene's claims here:

Here’s a breakdown of the claims and implications from the article, section by section:

---

### **1. ChatGPT Search Could Destroy Online Businesses**

**Claim:**  
ChatGPT and competing AI chatbots are outperforming Google Search for users seeking contextual and detailed responses, potentially threatening online businesses reliant on search traffic.

**Analysis:**

- **Impact on Online Businesses:** Businesses dependent on search engine optimization (SEO) to drive traffic might lose visibility as users shift from Google to AI tools like ChatGPT.
- **Strategies Suggested:**
    - Build direct connections with your audience through personalized email marketing.
    - Increase multi-channel content distribution to establish a robust brand presence.
    - Leverage platform-specific features to stay relevant and competitive.

**Critical Takeaway:**  
Adapting to a shifting search landscape by focusing on audience engagement, direct communication, and diverse content strategies is essential for survival.

### **2. Digital Clones for Web Conference Calls**

**Claim:**  
Tech platform Pickle allows users to create digital avatars that mimic their presence during web conferences, syncing with their voice and working across major platforms like Zoom and Teams.

[TechCrunch Pickle Article](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/23/how-a-digital-you-can-sit-through-your-agonizing-web-conference-calls/?guccounter=1)

>What the fuck is Pickle

### **Summary: Digital Avatars for Web Conference Calls**

A startup called **Pickle** offers a service that lets users create digital avatars for virtual meetings. By submitting a **five-minute training video**, users can generate an avatar that mimics their appearance and voice, allowing them to appear present on Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams without actually being there. The service costs between **$300 to $1,150 per year**, depending on the plan. Currently, it only works on macOS, with a Windows version expected soon. Due to high demand, avatar generation is delayed.

The startup is backed by **Krew Capital**, and while the technology offers convenience for remote work, it raises questions about practicality, ethics, and potential misuse.


> OK so it's just lying to your boss for $300 a year or more. Subscribe to lay in bed on your weekly standup.

**Analysis:**

- **Potential Business Use:**
    - Could reduce time spent in meetings while maintaining appearances.
    - Supports accessibility for multilingual participants via voice syncing.
- **Ethical Concerns:**
    - The author strongly condemns misuse, viewing it as deceptive and unethical.

**Critical Takeaway:**  
While tools like this may offer convenience, businesses need clear policies to regulate usage to avoid ethical and productivity issues.

>So the rising demand for people to be in bullshit meetings has now created a multimillion dollar business with many startups now competing to see which of them is the most convincing deceiver and can make you look like you're working the most. Right. This is as clear an indictment of the current economic system as I've ever seen


---

### **3. Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Drives Increased Spending**

**Claim:**  
A study shows that BNPL services increase consumer spending by 10%, especially among those who typically make smaller purchases.

**Analysis:**

- **Advantages for Businesses:**
    - Increases sales and attracts customers without credit cards.
    - Encourages spending by offering flexible payment plans.
- **Risks:**
    - Financially vulnerable customers may accumulate unsustainable debt.
    - Merchants risk reputational damage if consumers face unexpected penalties.

**Critical Takeaway:**  
Businesses offering BNPL should educate customers about its benefits and risks to ensure responsible usage and protect their brand image.

>Obviously???
>I mean, of course it will. If I can have the thing now and worry about money later, I'm gonna do that every time. WTF Gene this isn't an insight. Come on man I would expect the president of the MarksGroup to have a lot more insight on the current economy of broke bitches 

---

### **4. Securely Deleting Hard Drive Data Using Diskpart**

**Claim:**  
Diskpart, a Windows tool, can securely delete all data from a hard drive by overwriting it with zeros, making it inaccessible.

**Analysis:**

- **Suitability:**
    - Effective for traditional hard drives (HDDs).
    - Not recommended for solid-state drives (SSDs), which require specialized tools for secure deletion.
- **Use Case:**
    - Useful for securely preparing devices for trade-ins or transfers without physically destroying them.

**Critical Takeaway:**  
Diskpart offers a cost-effective, secure method for HDD data erasure. For SSDs, businesses should explore alternative solutions.

>Gene. You haven't tried it out, but you're about to??

>Bro
>
>This is the ad everyone. This is the ad. People, what you need to know about articles like this is that there is ALWAYS an ad buried inside and that these type of articles are almost ALWAYS written by AI, or some exploited copywriter in the Philippines.
>
>And then we get the "Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn" links at the bottom IT'S NOT CALLED TWITTER ANYMORE GENE
>UPDATE YOUR AI

![[Screen Shot 2024-12-01 at 2.56.06 PM.png]]

>This is an ad. When artists complain about AI slop...this is AI slop. Those images generated by Midjourney and everything else, scientifically proven to be amazing. Preferred by literally everyone who sees them in a double blind study. Super super good. however, this??? GARBAGE
>No one should ever read this and stuff like this shouldn't exist.
>Gene. Knock it off.

# AI Feedback

This script is a **solid draft**, packed with personality and humor that grabs attention. Here's what works and what could be improved:

---

### **Strengths:**

1. **Humor & Voice:**
    
    - Your tone is witty and engaging, creating a connection with viewers.
    - Lines like “Hope that gets better… Sorry Eagles” and “This is as clear an indictment of the current economic system as I've ever seen” show your personality, keeping it entertaining.
2. **Critical Analysis:**
    
    - You dive deep into the subject, questioning the claims and motivations of the article and its author.
    - The ethical critique of tools like Pickle adds depth and thoughtfulness.
3. **Engagement Prompts:**
    
    - Your audience questions are well-placed and thought-provoking, encouraging interaction.

---

### **Opportunities for Improvement:**

1. **Focus the Narrative:**
    
    - It feels a bit scattered. Aim to create a clear thread connecting Gene Marks, AI impacts, and the broader message about adapting to tech shifts.
    - Consider starting with a thesis statement, e.g., "AI isn’t just reshaping business—it’s redefining the rules. Let’s break down why Gene Marks thinks that’s bad."
2. **Simplify for Flow:**
    
    - Some sections feel overly detailed (e.g., Gene’s credentials). While context is helpful, tighten these parts to keep the pace snappy.
    - Example: Condense the LinkedIn/Twitter dive into, “Gene’s a CPA and consultant who writes prolifically about tech. He knows his stuff but let’s see if his predictions hold water.”
3. **Polish the Punchlines:**
    
    - While the jokes are great, they sometimes overpower the point. Balance humor with focus to keep the audience informed and entertained.
4. **End with a Call to Action (CTA):**
    
    - Tie everything together by summarizing the implications for businesses and individuals, then encourage viewers to adapt and innovate.

---

### **Suggestions for the Video:**

1. **Dynamic Editing:**
    
    - Use visuals like screenshots, animations, and text overlays to emphasize key points and jokes.
    - Incorporate a dramatic “reveal” when debunking sensational claims.
2. **Structure:**
    
    - **Intro:** Set up the topic and thesis (AI’s disruption and adapting to it).
    - **Middle:** Break into sections for each claim (e.g., Search, Pickle, BNPL), adding critiques and humor.
    - **Conclusion:** Summarize, offer actionable advice (like how to prepare for AI disruption), and pose engagement questions.
3. **Interactive Elements:**
    
    - Include polls or ask viewers to share examples of how they’ve adapted to AI in their lives.

---

If you refine the pacing, focus the narrative, and balance humor with insight, this could be a killer video that not only entertains but establishes you as a credible, sharp voice in the tech space.

**Title:** ChatGPT vs. Online Businesses: Is AI the Real Threat?

---

**[Intro]**

Hey there, tech enthusiasts and curious minds! Welcome back to another deep dive into the wild world of AI and business. Today, we're tackling a hot topic that's got everyone buzzing: Could ChatGPT search capabilities destroy online businesses? Let's unpack this sensational claim and see what's really going on.

---

**[Segment 1: The Sensational Article]**

So, I came across this Forbes article titled _"ChatGPT Search Could Destroy Online Businesses."_ Sounds dramatic, right? The piece is penned by Gene Marks, a certified public accountant and a prolific writer who covers tech impacts on small businesses. Gene's got quite the resume—he runs a tech and financial management consulting firm, speaks on the economy, and hosts podcasts. In other words, he's no stranger to the business world.

But here's the kicker: Gene is suggesting that AI tools like ChatGPT are outperforming traditional search engines and could potentially threaten businesses that rely heavily on search traffic. Bold claim! Let's see if there's substance behind the hype.

---

**[Segment 2: Breaking Down the Claims]**

**Claim 1: ChatGPT Outshines Google Search**

Gene argues that AI chatbots are providing more contextual and detailed responses than Google, which could divert traffic away from websites that depend on SEO.

_My Take:_ It's true that AI tools are changing how we search for information. But will they "destroy" online businesses? That's a stretch. Businesses have always adapted to new technology—from the rise of the internet to social media marketing. This is just the next evolution, Gene.

**Claim 2: Businesses Should Pivot Strategies**

Gene suggests that to survive, businesses need to:

- Build direct connections with their audience through personalized email marketing. (wow big insight there Gene, is this 2008?)
- Diversify content distribution across multiple channels. (ok, I'll get with you there. That's good advice. You definitely need to diversify your attention source just like you need to diversify your income streams.)
- Leverage platform-specific features to stay competitive.(Again, kinda...duh?)

_My Take:_ This isn't groundbreaking—it's Marketing 101. I get it though, this is probably an AI generated article. 

---

**[Segment 3: The Pickle of Digital Clones**

Now, let's talk about this wild concept: digital clones for web conference calls. Gene mentions a platform called Pickle that lets you create a digital avatar to attend meetings on your behalf. Yes, you heard that right—a digital you that nods along in Zoom meetings while you... do other things.

_Ethical Concerns:_ Okay, let's pump the brakes. While the idea sounds convenient, isn't this veering into deceptive territory? If you're not actually present in a meeting, should your avatar be?

This is a clear indictment of the capitalist structure and system of how we work. Never have I seen a more obvious indication that there is a lot of bullshit being forced onto people.

I mean if there's now a bunch of startups faking your presence in your morning standup meeting then do we really need the standup? This is just the tip of the iceberg Gene.



---

**[Segment 4: Buy Now, Pay Later—The Spending Trap**

Gene brings up a study showing that Buy Now, Pay Later services increase consumer spending by 10%, especially among those who usually make smaller purchases.

_My Take:_ Is anyone surprised by this? Offering flexible payment options encourages people to spend more—that's retail psychology 101. While it's beneficial for boosting sales, it also raises concerns about consumers accumulating debt. Like, duh. If I'm gonna be able to get the Playstation now and worry about money later, I'm locking in. Drop me onto the battlefield let's go. Fuck the money I'll worry about rent on the 1st.

---

**[Segment 5: Securely Deleting Data—A Side Note**

Lastly, Gene touches on using Diskpart, a Windows tool, to securely erase hard drive data by overwriting it with zeros.

This is an ad. Everyone. This is the ad. If AI haters are right about one thing it's that we have WAY TOO MUCH AI SLOP lobbed around, getting everything dirty and muddy with its slimy grossness. Stop doing this Gene. Stop writing articles like this. It'll never pay off in the long run and we're gonna see a SHARP decline in how many AI generated slop-pieces there are in the world, you can mark my words.
