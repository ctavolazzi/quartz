- **Strategies Suggested:**
    - Build direct connections with your audience through personalized email marketing.

>What the fuck is Pickle

### **Summary: Digital Avatars for Web Conference Calls**

A startup called **Pickle** offers a service that lets users create digital avatars for virtual meetings. By submitting a **five-minute training video**, users can generate an avatar that mimics their appearance and voice, allowing them to appear present on Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams without actually being there. The service costs between **$300 to $1,150 per year**, depending on the plan. Currently, it only works on macOS, with a Windows version expected soon. Due to high demand, avatar generation is delayed.

The startup is backed by **Krew Capital**, and while the technology offers convenience for remote work, it raises questions about practicality, ethics, and potential misuse.

**Analysis:**

- **Potential Business Use:**
    - Could reduce time spent in meetings while maintaining appearances.
    - Supports accessibility for multilingual participants via voice syncing.
- **Ethical Concerns:**
    - The author strongly condemns misuse, viewing it as deceptive and unethical.

**Critical Takeaway:**  
While tools like this may offer convenience, businesses need clear policies to regulate usage to avoid ethical and productivity issues.

### **3. Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Drives Increased Spending**

**Claim:**

    - Encourages spending by offering flexible payment plans.
- **Risks:**
    - Financially vulnerable customers may accumulate unsustainable debt.

    - Not recommended for solid-state drives (SSDs), which require specialized tools for secure deletion.
- **Use Case:**

**Claim:**  
A survey indicates that 64% of companies plan to boost IT budgets, focusing on generative AI (54%), security solutions (52%), and laptops (47%). Simultaneously, 92% plan cost-saving measures, particularly in areas related to "people."
