### Uncertain Future for AI Regulations Under Republican-Controlled Government

**Authors:** Dan Merica and Ali Swenson | _Associated Press (via ABC News)_  
**Date:** November 28, 2024

---

#### **Overview**

As the U.S. government transitions to Republican control, the approach to artificial intelligence (AI) policy is expected to shift from prioritizing safeguards to reducing regulatory barriers. This change creates opportunities for innovation but raises concerns about the absence of guardrails for AI development, particularly in elections and misinformation.

---

#### **Key Insights**

1. **Trump Administration‚Äôs Approach:**
    
    - President-elect Donald Trump plans to rescind President Biden's comprehensive AI executive order.
    - The Republican platform emphasizes ‚ÄúFree Speech and Human Flourishing‚Äù in AI policy.
    - A focus on deregulation may result in less oversight of AI-generated content in elections.
2. **Congressional Perspectives:**
    
    - Republican lawmakers are hesitant to regulate AI in ways that could be seen as limiting innovation or free speech.
    - Bipartisan interest exists in areas like national security and addressing non-consensual explicit images.
    - Democratic Senator Gary Peters expressed optimism for collaboration on some AI issues.
3. **AI in Elections and Campaigns:**
    
    - Campaigns used AI to create memes, target voters, and automate content, deepening partisan divisions.
    - Incidents included AI-generated robocalls mimicking Joe Biden‚Äôs voice and foreign actors spreading disinformation.
    - Despite fears, AI deepfakes did not significantly influence election outcomes but contributed to voter distrust.
4. **Industry and Expert Reactions:**
    
    - **Proponents:**
        - Industry groups, like The Software Alliance, advocate for national AI standards to foster innovation and market growth.
    - **Critics:**
        - Concerns about Trump‚Äôs reliance on advisers like Elon Musk, whose business interests may conflict with impartial policy-making.
        - Advocacy groups warn against rolling back Biden-era safeguards, emphasizing their role in promoting both safety and innovation.

---

#### **Challenges Ahead**

1. **Lack of Comprehensive Legislation:**
    
    - Congress has yet to pass a significant AI-related bill, leaving regulatory gaps.
    - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) halted AI-related regulation efforts due to the administrative transition.
2. **Potential for Misinformation:**
    
    - Deregulation risks increasing the use of AI-generated disinformation, particularly in elections.
    - AI tools can amplify false narratives, further eroding public trust in media and institutions.
3. **Balancing Innovation and Safety:**
    
    - Advocates argue for regulation to create ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù that promote responsible AI development while protecting users.

---

#### **Future Outlook**

The incoming administration‚Äôs deregulatory stance offers opportunities for economic growth but raises critical questions about accountability and public safety. Without federal regulations, states or private entities may need to fill the gap, potentially creating fragmented and inconsistent AI policies.
