### Play-By-Play
```
Please give me a complete and comprehensive play-by-play of the actions you took, starting at the beginning of the chat. Give me your reasoning - tell me WHY you took each action. What was your goal? What were you trying to achieve? Did you achieve your goal? How would we test it and check? How would we know? Thank you for your effort I appreciate you.
