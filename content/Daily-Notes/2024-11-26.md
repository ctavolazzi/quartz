## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Tue, 11/26/2024, 19:47`
4 weeks left in the year.
Just 34 more days until the end of 2024.
If you had told me at the end of last year that I'd be in this position I would have  not believed you.
So much has happened. So many plot events in so little time. 
The game has been set. The match is lit and the snowball has been pushed.
It's only a matter of time now until I'm the "next hottest thing" lol.
I'm not sure why fame makes me so uncomfortable. I just find it to be silly. There are much more deserving people out there than me and yet here I am, being selected over and over again by the universe for the spotlight. Why me? I think about this often.

`Tue, 11/26/2024, 19:48`
Whatever it is I have to give to the world, I hope it's worth all of this. I hope it's worth it, cuz this all has been quite overwhelming. 
It's time. I'm ready. I'm 35 years old now.
Denzel said "First part of your life you learn, second part you earn, third part you return."
He was completely right.
I'm in the earning phase now. My learning is finally complete. I understand now how most of the things I touch on a daily basis work. Computers, TV, marketing, psychology, communication, storytelling, cellphones, global communications networks, YouTube, social media like TikTok, music, entertainment, business both large and small, contracts, banking, and even war.
I understand at least a small amount about all of it. 
I understand enough of myself to know where my own limitations are as well. I know people can deceive me and in what ways I'm vulnerable. I've been through enough situations now to know where I should and shouldn't be. 
It's time for me to step it up and start doing YouTube.
I'm nervous as all hell, and it's because I care, and I know I'm gonna be good at it. I know what lies in store for me and I'm...finally ready.

`Tue, 11/26/2024, 20:00`
It's time to start scripting. I'm ready. It's a HUGE decision. Reorienting my life and my identity around what I actually want...now that's what I'm talking about.
You can either do something about it, or you can live with it forever. Time to make this final transition into the man I've always been meant to be.
You asked for me.
Here I am.

`Tue, 11/26/2024, 20:04`
Could you imagine what I'd be like if I were let loose? Empowered?
I'm my own limit. I'm the last thing standing in my own way.
It's time. It's time to do this.

`Tue, 11/26/2024, 20:10`
The feelings are indescribable. the potency I'm about to unleash in myself...cuz it's not about them anymore. The whole time they've been in my head, and I've been trying to satisfy every person from my past who's ever been mad at me. My family most of all. But I'm just...not going to do that anymore.
What if I prioritized myself for once? What if I did everything in my power to create a life full of infinite abundance for myself and my loved ones? What if I didn't care about what kind of shitty things people would say and didn't let their opinions stop me from making things better for me and everyone who ever meets me?
I deserve this, regardless of whether or not my loved ones love me back the same way or treat me with the same respect I give them.
I deserve to have the things I've seen others have. I deserve to have this story. I deserve it, and I'm going to use what I build to make the lives of my loved ones better. 
The best thing you can do for the ones you love is to take really, really good care of yourself, so that they benefit from your presence. Balance is super important and we definitely deserve to have one another take care of each other.
I am enough. I always was. So are you, reader. We are enough. We always were. They were wrong about us.

`Tue, 11/26/2024, 20:18`
What would I want my life to look like if it wasn't perfect, but instead, was just really, really, really extremely good.
That's enough man. That's more than enough after what I just went through.
Ok, pain processed. I feel better. It's definitely time and I'm definitely ready to see what happens next when I become a YouTuber.
I'll become a YouTuber, like [[penguinz0]] or [[Jenna Marbles]] or [[PewDiePie]] or any of my other heroes who paved the way. 
They ran so I could walk.
Play the game, retire with a healthy body at 37
People will look forward to watching my videos and they will form opinions based on what I say. I have a responsibility, and I intend to step up to it.
I can make content about anything. I AM the content. 
I embrace my role. I embrace my new identity.
I am a Youtuber. I don't care what you have to say about it unless it's constructive feedback on how I can get better at making great videos for people to enjoy.

`Tue, 11/26/2024, 20:23`
We will start with scripting the first video, which will frame the content of my channel - "Preparing for the Arrival of Superintelligent AI"
Then the rest of my channel will cover what I'm personally doing to prepare for the arrival of superintelligent AI. 
My channel will be predicated on the fact that people around the world are achieving incredibly amazing advancements in science and I want to be a part of that. I want to be part of the revolution. And I want to be LOUD about it. I'm not afraid of what they're going to say. I am afraid of what I might miss out on if I don't do this.

"I'm sorry," they say, "you can't change the way things are."

"Watch me." I say.

Given your background as a software developer and your emphasis on quality and efficiency, today could be an excellent opportunity for you to reflect on how your workflows impact your creativity and productivity. 

### Insight:
**Leverage Iterative Learning for Continuous Improvement**  
Since you're already tracking your daily progress and engaging in community activities, consider applying the principle of iterative learning to your projects. Reflect on what you accomplished yesterday and identify one area where you faced challenges. Instead of seeing this as a setback, treat it as a chance to experiment with a new approach or tool.
