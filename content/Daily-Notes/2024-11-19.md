Ok, I'm ready. It's time, I'm good to go. Let's do this. I'm about to make myself famous on YouTube just...being myself and making good content. That's it. Commentary on current events, and my own life. That's the whole thing. My little slice of reality, my mind, on display for the world to see, on YouTube, so it's scalable, doing things I understand alone, and I'll have to deal with zero of the negativities because I just waited them out. I did it...but at great personal and professional cost. However, I did it. I'm ready to go. This is going to happen and once I kick this snowball off the hill I can't stop it. I'm ready to make my digital footprint. Let's forge a path!

Starting with this silly little game and all the work that's gone into understanding it. How all these things work. I get it now at a level that's hard to explain. I understand just a little about basically everything and I'm ready to really understand it by doing it. That's the goal - to collect money and start doing stuff without anyone being able to stand in my way. YouTube will be the only barrier and I'm more than happy to let them take on the responsibilities of hosting video at that scale. I'm happy to tie my life to YouTube. Let's do it. That's the last barrier and I've broken it down. Finally...the end is nigh. Let's let my fate be whatever it will be. Let's join the circus. Let them hate me, or love me. But let them hate or love ***ME*** not some imagined or made up version of me. Let me be bare to the world, dolled up my best, but also visible at my most raw. Let them tear me limb from limb and let me show that it doesn't matter as long as you're skilled and you perservere.
I'm ready to show that someone like me can do it.
Let's show them that they were wrong about me. Let's begin.

The YouTube lifestyle begins. It is whatever I decide it to be. "Whatever I do is the actions of a Nobel Prize Winner because I have won a Nobel Prize" type energy from here out. Observe, make choices, stay true, keep it real.
In my lane, moisturized, focused, real. That's where we're headed next, that's the vibe. That's what we're doing next. Yeehaw amigo - let's do this....

Shit I'm doing it again. I'm making yet another Python game...
But it's because each time I do it I learn more and get closer to making this work as a package and making this something I can extend with AI.

I find I have to tell the new Claude in the API to chill the fuck out regularly. It goes off the rails a lot. It's like "I KNOW HOW TO FIX THAT HERE" no you don't Claude, fucking relax. Stop poisoning the context we had some good alchemy going there fuck.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 10:41`
I'm doing this because it's a really good benchmark. It's a great way to test myself AND the system. I can text how much I understand, how effective my communication and planning is, and I can also test these AI systems to see if they can just "handle it" for me (spoiler: they can't. Not yet. Soon tho)

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 10:45`
Here's the game development file!

There we go that's my first batch of YouTube content: 
>I'm making a generative AI choose your own adventure game called Teleport Massive and I'm documenting the entire process here on YouTube

Think of it as > * Documentation * < not as a > * Performance * <

You're not being judged. You're being observed. There's a little judgement but it has to do with the person judging, not you. It's not a "is this person good enough" it's more of an "am I better than this person?" and that's something you don't need to even consider as the creator.

Katie is going to Chicago
Has spent time, has a friend, her partner's brother used to live in the Shamburg area, and they're looking for stuff. They haven't been there to scope things out, and under normal circumstances, they would be more concerned. This is less of a move, this is a political choice to be more safe.
The political and social climate of Georgia has been getting worse and worse and Katie doesn't want to be there anymore.
Katie had bought a house and is turning to the tech industry, they are an engineer at Briggs and Scanton, building commercial engines for zero turns and different utilities, building engines for gas powered welders, avocado pickers, all sorts of random crap. Would love to help with the stuff that's going on with the robots.

Tara's name is "tah-ruh" like taruh lore we made a joke about a tarah-lore-a-saurus

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 08:16`
Katie's parents have a rental house. If it doesn't pan out then they'll have a place to go.

THE JARVIS AI PROJECTOR MATT THING IS FOR SALE?!?!?!
[This thing](https://www.tiktok.com/@concept_bytes/video/7338233738733653290?lang=en)
Katie told us that it's actually something you can buy now...? Wild I really hope so that would be amazing.
Also, Katie is building a [[Claude Projects]] based API programmatically based AI C-3PO head that is 3D printed.
[[D-3TO]] there it is the head lives here's the [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@d3toh?lang=en)

Darren is working on a project called "Moringa" it's apparently so easy to adapt the program to different purposes and functions.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 08:49`
Ben chimed in and said he's fed up with the job application process and experimented with doing an AI bot that helps with job applications. That seems like the perfect low hanging fruit - a bot system that helps us get out needs me.

Barb said a name your own price option for the Multiverse would be a great option - if money is an issue take that up with your psychologist - for her it's a duh that if you're giving me something there must be something in exchange - we want to succeed as a team and her goal is learning about AI and Python. She paid for each class one by one and is now in Prompt engineering. The processing of the ethics, and for her to process, she goes and teaches, and now she's teaching some of the stuff we're teaching here in the Multiverse School. If you want to do the gift economy or the barter economy. 
Ben chimed in and said he doesn't know anything about business but knows about Python and is doing stuff with his knowledge and focusing on the lack of experience.

[[JKL]] is gonna start hosting a student project lab - low pressure, once a week, JKL is here and in a room full of people we will all troubleshoot the thing and  help it move forward. Thursdays at 9AM Pacific
Collaboration on the projects is something Ben is interested in.

Yay we did it!! I practiced talking about this stuff again and now I'm gonna go into one of those soundproof booths and record myself yapping about all this stuff. I'm gonna take the bus to the storage unit, grab my mic, take some pictures of all the things, and then go back to Stoble and work. This is my workplace now. I don't know why I didn't do this sooner.
