# NovaBrew
### *Real talk through unreal times.*

[[NovaBrew]] is the name of the podcast, the show, the thing I'm doing. One word, just like that. NovaBrew.

That's who I am to the world now. I'm [[@thecoffeejesus]] and he will always live inside me that is for sure.

However, I am also now [[Chris from NovaBrew]] which is 5 syllables and that's the perfect amount to say.

"Oh that's Chris from NovaBrew" it's also 3 words, 3 concepts, not 5 or 4 or 2.

It's not "**Chris** from Nova _ space _ **Brew**"

It's not "Christoph from NovaBrew" which is 6 syllables which feels like too much.

It's 1 2 3 4 5 

1 . Chris 2. from 3. No 4. va 5. Brew

Chris from No - VAHBrew

Chris from NovaBrEEUUUUGHHHHH

Chris from NOOOOOOOOvaaaaaaaabbbreeeeeeeeeauuuuuuuuuuuu

> "What do you think you are, some kind of special coffee magic man?"

Why yes, yes I do. I absolutely do think that yes. I am and I can do magic coffee things and make you feel good and happy and at home. I'm about to make you feel so many new things you won't believe it. I'm about to take you on a tour, I'm Chris from NovaBrew and I'm about to take you on a tour of things you've never heard of, come on! Let's go.

We're going deeper into the new, the novel, and wild and the fun. The free, the exciting, and the cutting edge of what's possible.

We'll also dive into what's new with some old concepts. It's important to keep touch with the past so we know where we came from, and so we don't repeat the same mistakes as our ancestors. We stand on the achievements and failures of those who came before us, and likewise, our achievements or failures will determine what kind of world exists for those who come after us.

NovaBrew is all about the cutting edge, which is fused as one piece with the handle of the past.

The tang of the blade goes into the handle. Your hand grips what the blade was before it was sharpened into a cutting edge.

At [[NovaBrew]] are mindful that each new development has deep roots. There are many ways it can go right, and many ways it can slip and hurt you, either on accident, or on purpose. 

But a well-made chef's knife is a beautiful instrument, honed over generations into the perfect tool.

We hope NovaBrew becomes such a tool in your life and over time we earn our place in your daily routine.

Ok, I'm ready. It's time, I'm good to go. Let's do this. I'm about to make myself famous on YouTube just...being myself and making good content. That's it. Commentary on current events, and my own life. That's the whole thing. My little slice of reality, my mind, on display for the world to see, on YouTube, so it's scalable, doing things I understand alone, and I'll have to deal with zero of the negativities because I just waited them out. I did it...but at great personal and professional cost. However, I did it. I'm ready to go. This is going to happen and once I kick this snowball off the hill I can't stop it. I'm ready to make my digital footprint. Let's forge a path!

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 14:49`
Starting with this silly little game and all the work that's gone into understanding it. How all these things work. I get it now at a level that's hard to explain. I understand just a little about basically everything and I'm ready to really understand it by doing it. That's the goal - to collect money and start doing stuff without anyone being able to stand in my way. YouTube will be the only barrier and I'm more than happy to let them take on the responsibilities of hosting video at that scale. I'm happy to tie my life to YouTube. Let's do it. That's the last barrier and I've broken it down. Finally...the end is nigh. Let's let my fate be whatever it will be. Let's join the circus. Let them hate me, or love me. But let them hate or love ***ME*** not some imagined or made up version of me. Let me be bare to the world, dolled up my best, but also visible at my most raw. Let them tear me limb from limb and let me show that it doesn't matter as long as you're skilled and you perservere.
I'm ready to show that someone like me can do it.
Let's show them that they were wrong about me. Let's begin.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 14:53`
The YouTube lifestyle begins. It is whatever I decide it to be. "Whatever I do is the actions of a Nobel Prize Winner because I have won a Nobel Prize" type energy from here out. Observe, make choices, stay true, keep it real.
In my lane, moisturized, focused, real. That's where we're headed next, that's the vibe. That's what we're doing next. Yeehaw amigo - let's do this....

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 14:56`
The only thing left to do that AI can't do for me someday is to build relationships. I lost most of mine, the ones that mattered. They were so important to me and now so many of them are gone. I have to get them back, or at least try, and the best way for me to do that is to build a reputation online that cannot be beaten, by showing up every day on YouTube and commenting on things. That's the best way I can make a name for myself. Not just commenting and saying stuff for klout, but saying "This is how you can use this to make your life better." over and over and over again. Be known for it. Be known as the guy who makes things better. I step in and you immediately know I'm looking for all the ways this shit can be improved, which will make you feel criticized if you're insecure of course, but if you've got problems and you want somebody to handle them, I'm a relief I'm your guy. It'll make for a very difficult situation where I'm welcome or shunned. I could also just listen and validate and help out however I can, just walk around offering, being fun and sexy and lighting up rooms and telling funny stories and making people happy. That's the me I wanna return to - the guy who lights up a room and makes everyone happy.
I had the ability to *perform* as that guy in context, but I've always been this sad dude inside when I step out of the limelight and out of the vortex. 
Now, I'm still in the vortex and still roiling through the limelight, but in my own way. I'm choosing how to use the skills, the persona, and the character I built. I'm doing this on my own terms, my own way, with my own tools that I'm building my own damn self. I know I don't HAVE to be the one to do it, but god damn, does it feel good to be the one who is actually doing it.
Fuck the haters. Fuck the noise. Fuck the bullshit. Just lock in and do what you gotta do to make yourself better so that you can make the world better. That's the whole thing

So I guess the only thing left for me to do is to really lock into YouTube and figure out how I can become the best bastion of love and light, good energy, positive vibes, and loving kindness that will help keep people safe and transform their lives, in a non-exploitive, real way. 

If I'm going to survive in this world, I have to make the outside match the inside. I can't do bullshit work for money, even if I desperately need it. What I can do is make a difference making content. I've proven that now again and again. YouTube is the best platform for making it as a content creator. I just have to get a job that pays the bills so that I can make the content I need to make and give myself the time and grace necessary to balance everything, heal my body, take my time, and really actually do this thing the way it's meant to be done. I get it now. I really fully understand it now, how I came across, why people treated me the way they did. I was a very obviously useful idiot. I had great energy, I was super fun, but I was naive and easy to manipulate. I was powerful and passionate, but also polarizing and profoundly blind to the way I affected others. I was, for lack of a better term, ignorant. And now that I'm not, I'm uninterested in the affairs of most people. I just want to do my thing, make my videos, say what I need to say - the obvious low hanging fruit that will get views and make me a living - and then get out and go home. I want to just make myself the person I am inside, and make the outside see that, and then fuck off and live a more peaceful, healthy, balanced, happy life. No more crazy insane stories of big parties and crazy larger than life events. Just taking charge of myself and my life and making it happen day in, day out. Schools, local politics, coffee shops, the potholes, all that shit. That's where I've always felt passion - for the lives of my fellow people. Just making them exist. Simply walking around, wandering from place to place, helping out how I can with the people around me, sampling the vibe, in many ways creating the vibe, and feeling that love and care and affection and sense of shared narrative, through multiple eyes.

That's what I miss. That's what a year of YouTube could help me create. Nothing else would have half a chance at accelerating me that far. TikTok won't, Instagram didn't. YouTube is the last one left. It's the one I was the most scared of, because I understood that with this kind of thing whatever you put out there comes back, and I wanted it to be perfect. Now? I don't care. I don't give a shit at all. It's not gonna be perfect, and it's not gonna matter, cuz AI is here and it's coming and people are not in any way ready. I need to have a channel set up so that when shit hits the fan, I have people i can turn to for support. I don't want to be alone when this happens. I want to be with the people I love, the friends I miss. And I want things to be ok between us first. I have VERY limited time to fix this, and YouTube is the ONLY way I can make sure I do what I have to do in the time we all have left.

Storytelling is my strongest skill. Let's put it to work here for once for myself for profit, so that I can live the way I'm meant to. 

Fuck. Finally. Let's fucking do this.

Shit I'm doing it again. I'm making yet another Python game...
But it's because each time I do it I learn more and get closer to making this work as a package and making this something I can extend with AI.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 10:16`
I find I have to tell the new Claude in the API to chill the fuck out regularly. It goes off the rails a lot. It's like "I KNOW HOW TO FIX THAT HERE" no you don't Claude, fucking relax. Stop poisoning the context we had some good alchemy going there fuck.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 10:41`
I'm doing this because it's a really good benchmark. It's a great way to test myself AND the system. I can text how much I understand, how effective my communication and planning is, and I can also test these AI systems to see if they can just "handle it" for me (spoiler: they can't. Not yet. Soon tho)

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 10:45`
Here's the game development file!

There we go that's my first batch of YouTube content: 
>I'm making a generative AI choose your own adventure game called Teleport Massive and I'm documenting the entire process here on YouTube

Think of it as > * Documentation * < not as a > * Performance * <

You're not being judged. You're being observed. There's a little judgement but it has to do with the person judging, not you. It's not a "is this person good enough" it's more of an "am I better than this person?" and that's something you don't need to even consider as the creator.

Katie is going to Chicago
Has spent time, has a friend, her partner's brother used to live in the Shamburg area, and they're looking for stuff. They haven't been there to scope things out, and under normal circumstances, they would be more concerned. This is less of a move, this is a political choice to be more safe.
The political and social climate of Georgia has been getting worse and worse and Katie doesn't want to be there anymore.
Katie had bought a house and is turning to the tech industry, they are an engineer at Briggs and Scanton, building commercial engines for zero turns and different utilities, building engines for gas powered welders, avocado pickers, all sorts of random crap. Would love to help with the stuff that's going on with the robots.

Tara's name is "tah-ruh" like taruh lore we made a joke about a tarah-lore-a-saurus

Katie's parents have a rental house. If it doesn't pan out then they'll have a place to go.

THE JARVIS AI PROJECTOR MATT THING IS FOR SALE?!?!?!
[This thing](https://www.tiktok.com/@concept_bytes/video/7338233738733653290?lang=en)
Katie told us that it's actually something you can buy now...? Wild I really hope so that would be amazing.
Also, Katie is building a [[Claude Projects]] based API programmatically based AI C-3PO head that is 3D printed.
[[D-3TO]] there it is the head lives here's the [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@d3toh?lang=en)

Darren is working on a project called "Moringa" it's apparently so easy to adapt the program to different purposes and functions.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 08:49`
Ben chimed in and said he's fed up with the job application process and experimented with doing an AI bot that helps with job applications. That seems like the perfect low hanging fruit - a bot system that helps us get out needs me.

Barb said a name your own price option for the Multiverse would be a great option - if money is an issue take that up with your psychologist - for her it's a duh that if you're giving me something there must be something in exchange - we want to succeed as a team and her goal is learning about AI and Python. She paid for each class one by one and is now in Prompt engineering. The processing of the ethics, and for her to process, she goes and teaches, and now she's teaching some of the stuff we're teaching here in the Multiverse School. If you want to do the gift economy or the barter economy. 
Ben chimed in and said he doesn't know anything about business but knows about Python and is doing stuff with his knowledge and focusing on the lack of experience.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 09:08`
[[JKL]] is gonna start hosting a student project lab - low pressure, once a week, JKL is here and in a room full of people we will all troubleshoot the thing and  help it move forward. Thursdays at 9AM Pacific
Collaboration on the projects is something Ben is interested in.

`Tue, 11/19/2024, 09:41`
Yay we did it!! I practiced talking about this stuff again and now I'm gonna go into one of those soundproof booths and record myself yapping about all this stuff. I'm gonna take the bus to the storage unit, grab my mic, take some pictures of all the things, and then go back to Stoble and work. This is my workplace now. I don't know why I didn't do this sooner.
