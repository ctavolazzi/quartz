And just as I had predicted, it can basically 10-shot the [[NovaSystem]].
This is insane.

`Thu, 12/05/2024, 14:38`
Just had a very catalyzing conversation with my dear friend [[Max Kokinakas]]
I love this man. Wow, that was amazing. That was so incredible.
Now I'm joined into the [[Multiverse School]] researcher's meetup.

Ok [[o1]] is really good I'm about to go figure shit out I'm gonna meditate on what I just experienced with Max and the MVS crew, and now I'm gonna be vibing out and fully going through it. Meditating deep. Making things in my brain manifest. I'm about to pop baby. Here we fucking GOOOOOO

I argued with o1 and it refused to build itself. Rude lol
In the meantime, I got a version of the NovaSystem running in Gradio I think it's gonna work with just a little more troubleshooting.

`Thu, 12/05/2024, 18:59`
Troubleshooting commencing...

`Thu, 12/05/2024, 20:08`
Still troubleshooting...


`Thu, 12/05/2024, 20:14`
Am I finally gonna get it to output some code without refusing??
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-05 at 8.14.38 PM.png]]
lol nope

`Thu, 12/05/2024, 20:58`
Ok it's amazing, but it's suuuuuuper shitty still too. It's not gonna allow us to build it lol. Disappointing.

I'm brute forcing it with Flask
