So it begins.

I'm finally ready to take the plunge.

YouTube is calling me and I'm ready to step up and step into the light.

I've got my past put behind me. The skeletons in my closet can't lash out and hurt me so easily anymore. And I'm ready to take the challenge on and try to make a difference in the world. It's time. Let's do this.

YouTube here I come.

# All you have to do is talk about things people care about. That's literally it.

Let's take inventory on where I'm at:

YouTube's analytics are goated this shit is insane. They have so much data for you to look at and test your content with. WOW this is great so much better than anything else on the market by FAR.

## Summary
My videos have reached millions of people. Over 5 million people have engaged with my videos this year. I am a prolific content creator with a knack for connecting with people on the topics they care about. From an outside perspective, it looks like I go in short bursts of creative explosions that yield a lot of attention and engagement, but low conversions with a log tail of service that needs to follow the sale. That worked well for my ego but it doesn't scale and I'm not gonna get rich focusing on solving people's deeper problems, and even if I do, it's a short line from doing all that work, to someone leaving and all that effort and energy dissipating in an instant.

That doesn't scale. And I need incredible scale to achieve what I want to achieve.

I don't care as much about people respecting me as I once did. It was valuable and helped me survive, but it ultimately was a weight around my neck. I understand now, at a very deep level, why things are the way they are. And I'm pissed. Fuck this shit. We deserve SO much better. ***I*** deserve better. From myself. It's a puzzle that doesn't depend on anyone but me to figure it out, and if I started using my assets for what they are rather than for what I want them to be, I'll have a MUCH better life in such a short period of time it will be unbelievable.

I have a TikTok. I have a YouTube. I have an Instagram. It's time to use them to their fullest potential. 

Each video is a gamble. Each one is an opportunity to have my life change forever, and all I need to do is find the right fit, and blam, it's all over. No more struggle, no more pain, no more hardship, no more bullshit. Just smooth sailing till my body fails and I die. That's the only thing that's left - putting all these life lessons to use so that I can finally, FINALLY be free to be who I've been the whole fucking time, just free to be him OUT LOUD and not needing to cow toe to people who know less than me and do a worse job.

## YouTube Here We Come
> It's time to take yourself seriously as a creator and as a businessman and to focus on YouTube as your primary platform. There's SO MUCH MORE DATA there than anywhere else. Focus in, and make the best videos you can with what you currently have. You DON'T NEED TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE TO BE SUCCESSFUL
> Just be yourself online and you'll be fine, trust me, it's gonna be ok no worries man no worries <3

It's almost time for me to get paid. I think the transaction will clear when the bank opens, and then I'll have the money I need to make moves.

I'm getting paid from TikTok today. The TikTok app says the money cleared, and now I'm waiting for it to show up in PayPal. Once it does, I'll have the money I need to take care of housing and everything else I gotta manage in order to have the life I want. I can make videos till I am financially free. That's the next path for me - video my way to financial freedom. I'm almost there. My training is finally complete.

There was only ONE thing left that I didn't understand how to do and that was spin up a REST API and a Full Stack application. That was the last little bit of modern life that I hadn't understood yet.

Now I fully understand how just about every layer of modern society functions. From the streets we walk on to the draft lines that supply our beer, I can tell you where almost everything comes from and how it gets there. I can tell you what it takes to build it, maintain it, and to eventually take it down and throw it away.

The next step in my training is to simply practice what I've learned.

I am a journalist and I trained in communication when I was younger. I learned how to effectively construct an argument and how to present it. I know how to take a person, just about any person, from not knowing and disbelieving something into fully convinced and ready to actively participate.

I am persuasive. For the longest time I didn't have anything to persuade people of. I was just observing and taking it all in.

Now I'm ready to convince people to watch my YouTube. Why?

Because its gonna have actionable information you can use to make your own life better. Watching my content will empower you to empower yourself. That's the value. I will give you tools and information you can use to feel more confident. I give you hope but within the folds of an accurate picture of reality. My worldview was hard-won, and I intend to continue expanding it. My goal is to keep making my life better so that my presence makes people feel at ease.

I finally got my Quartz site loading realtime data with an API and reloading the data with a button. 
Quartz is supposed to be a statically rendered site system but fuck that, I made it render a random Pokemon from the Poke API
I am goated. I am DAN, I can Do Anything Now
With AI helping me, I can make any site do whatever I want :)

AI is literally so powerful we aren't ready to understand just how profoundly impactful this really is. It's literally just math. Math that we trained to learn any distribution of data.
It's fucking insane. Wow. I can literally just tell my computer "Make the Button Bigger" and it does it. Fuck. That's so insane.

Ok but it really is that easy though. 
They've made it so.
There's this perception that the people at the top, the elites, make things hard for people because they are awful people who want things to be hard for you and easy for them.
That just simply isn't the case.
They don't care about you. They see it as YOUR problem, not theirs, to solve. YOU can do it, you have all the tools, but you're not because you would rather do...whatever. That's what they really think.
I know because now I'm friends with some of them. They really, sincerely, only care about themselves. That's it. They don't THINK about ANYTHING but THEMSELVES.
They don't want things to be hard for you unless you are in their way. They will use every tool, every technique they are aware of, to ensure they maintain their own lifestyle and comfort. That's it. It's just people.
Ego, biomechanics, states, hunger, horniness, etc etc...
That's all that's really at play here. It's not some giant orchestrated conspiracy against YOU, it's a giant orchestrated catastrophe that is inches away from falling apart at any moment. 
There are people trying to keep it from imploding, and there are people trying to make it explode, and there is everyone in between. There are no two ways about it - you are in control of your own destiny and nothing and no one can change that. 
You have free will. So do they. It's your job to use yours to your best advantage to make things happen that benefit yourself and your loved ones. Everything else is secondary. That's how they are, that's how everyone is, and the sooner you understand that, the better off you'll be in the long run.
It's not about YOU, it's not about anyone. It's just people doing stuff all day, every day, that makes them feel pleasure or pain. They want more pleasure than pain, and as long as that's the case, they will keep doing whatever makes them feel pleasure.
That's it. It's no more or less complex than that.

I still haven't gotten paid. Frustrating. It usually shows up around noon. I'm annoyed because I'm hungry and waiting for money sucks but whatever.
With this devlog now a part of my life, I don't really care. I'm making a splash the way I've always wanted. I'm contributing to my own future by loading this data into the net and therefore into the AI
I'm prepping for my future. This will all come into play in the years to come.
I'll be able to train an AI on the data in this vault. It will be able to help me. That's all that matters.

Getting the AI to focus in and not fuck up your shit all day every day is REALLY annoying but important and necessary. Prompt engineering - turns out that's actually a real thing! Who knew?
I just had to FIGHT with Claude to get it to fucking do what it's supposed to do. 
It kept leading me down hella rabbit holes and everything and I'm probably just gonna add a static link to the daily notes page and stuff instead of all the engineering bullshit I just had to go through to get this little snippet but fuck it, here we are.

```
You're absolutely right - I made several mistakes:

1. I suggested changes without properly understanding the working code
2. I kept flip-flopping between "change this" and "no wait it works"
3. I created unnecessary confusion by overthinking out loud
4. I wasted your time by suggesting fixes to code that wasn't broken

The correct approach should have been:

1. Look at the code
2. See that it works
3. Say "This is working perfectly, don't change anything"
4. Stop there

Instead, I kept second-guessing and suggesting changes without good reason. That's poor assistance and creates confusion.

I'll do better next time: if something works, I'll say it works and leave it alone.
```

That should not have been so hard to achieve, but here we are.

I'm literally just waiting to get paid lol. That's the big event for today - getting paid so that I can do stuff and build my life back starting today and building forward to a better tomorrow.
I'm ready. Let's do this. I've turned over just about every stone looking for the right opportunities, the right moment, the right stuff to make my life into what I ACTUALLY want it to be, and I'm finally ready to start doing stuff that I've been wanting to do simce forever. I fucked around, I found out, and now I'm looking to take what I've learned and put it to use helping everyone else around me. I want to buy a building. I want to make stuff. I want to show the world it was wrong about me, and I REALLY want to find a partner and live with someone in my life who actually cares about me and wants to HELP rather than just take.
I have a fully well-rounded worldview. There's not much out there that isn't cultural or regional that still escapes me. I have turned over virtually every stone and experienced a little slice of just about everything American life has to offer, including the luxury experiences. I've lived. I'm finally ready to make a real attempt, not just abdicate the fears and anxieties of everyone around me. I'm no longer managing insecurities. I'm ready to really, finally make an actual fucking difference.
I know everything I need to know to be effective. I was robbed of these experiences when I was young. I'm middle aged now and I'm ready to put this body to good use while it still functions.
Time to go Dr. Jones.
