### o3

OpenAI announces a new model.

It's incredible at programming. Math. 96.7% accuracy on Competitive Math.
It misses only one question on the math olympiad
87.7% correct on PhD level science.
ARC benchmark
President of the Arc foundation was PRESENT and sitting on the livestream. North star toward AGI
ARC AGI 2019 by fancois chollet
Unbeaten for 5 years.
New state of the art score to announce
Arc AGI is about having input examples and output examples
Arc AGI version 1 took 5 years to go from not passing to passing.
o3 scored 75.7 on Arc AGI semi-private holdout set
New number 1 entry on Arc AGI hub
When they ask o3 to think longer, it scored 87.5% on the same problem set.
Human capability is at 85% threshold
The president literally said "I need to change my worldview. The work is not over yet. We need more enduring benchmarks to monitor and guide progress. We are excited to work with OpenAI to develop new benchmarks. Ark prize will continue into 2025."

Hony Yu Ren - model trainer

3 options:
- low, medium, and high reasoning time

Evals:
- coding:
	- Sam "For an order of magnitude lower in cost, we can deliver the same performance as the larger frontier models, or higher."
- new cost-efficient frontier on coding, math, science, every fucking thing

LIVE DEMO
03-minii is half the latency of o1
Achieves better performance with scaling of thinking and time at inference and compute.

# Release - End of January, Early February

Wow. We just hit something significant. A true step change today.

Tonight I am at Stoble getting things ready, listing the Cognex and the Allen-Bradley parts on Ebay

I'm gonna run a little experiment on escapecapitalism.org where I have an AI model perform capitalism in a little game of evolutionary iterative development. I want to make an AI do capitalism in a simulated environment.

See [[Projects/AI-Capitalism-Sim/EscapeCapitalism-Technical-Specs|EscapeCapitalism Technical Specs]] for implementation details.

I found the fastest and easiest source of money and I'm going to earn, if it's what it appears to be, about $2500-$3000 from selling these microcontrollers, and then about another $2500-$3000 from selling these cables, and then yet ANOTHER $2500-$3000 selling other unrelated items, which means I should have about $6000 of play money coming to me for the season if I can get all this shit sold.
Bonkers dude. Bananas.

Escape Capitalism - I can pretty much expect to be able to one-shot these kind of games and apps with [[o3]] huh...

I want to see if Claude can develop a game in the browser with abstract english instructions. Let's find out...

`Fri, 12/20/2024, 21:49`
I love the iterative development process these LLMs use. Can't wait to apply it to science and robots. This is gonna be fucking COOL

`Fri, 12/20/2024, 23:49`
Ok I got it working. I have two AI models talking to one another in a chat window, doing some simulated capitalism. This is sick as fuck. Damn. As I learn to do more of this...
