## 📝 Daily Reflections

Ok.

Let's build "Escape Capitalism" into a live dashboard for the world. The whole point will be monitoring things that should be monitored, and paying attention to things that should be paid attention to. I want to be able to log in and have everything I want to know about loaded into my dashboard.

We actually have development timelines for the AI now. [[o3]] drops in 2 months. We have January and February and then we will all have access to a PhD level coder. I can just have it develop these ideas out for me. 

So the way I see it the more progress I can make now on getting my ideas build to the point where I can show the advanced AI what I was thinking and just have it finish the engineering for me is peak. That's what I'm trying to get ready for.

The coming lurch of the public screaming "What are we supposed to do now?" is something I'm getting ready for. It's something I've BEEN getting ready for ever since the [[Gentle Bull]] days. 

Now I'm battle hardened. I've wet my teeth in the arena of social media. I've gotten myself forged into damascus steel by the flames of the haters.

The constant question:
### "What will be the impact to society, and how does the next generation prepare?"

I got the ideas now. I got the drive. I got the conversions. I got the sauce man. The pizza is under the sauce!

Ok ok ok ok

Let's do that real fast...

I did it.
I put in my reps and now look at what I can do.
In just a few hours of work look at what I accomplished. Look at these fucking pages:

- https://escapecapitalism.org
- https://thecoffeejesus.com
- https://johnnyautoseed.com

Those three sites are all I need to stay retired. Forever. 
I'll never have a job again if I do this right. If it works out, [[AES Solar]] will be the last job I ever have.
