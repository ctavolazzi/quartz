## üìù Daily Reflections


Ok.

Let's build "Escape Capitalism" into a live dashboard for the world. The whole point will be monitoring things that should be monitored, and paying attention to things that should be paid attention to. I want to be able to log in and have everything I want to know about loaded into my dashboard.

We actually have development timelines for the AI now. [[o3]] drops in 2 months. We have January and February and then we will all have access to a PhD level coder. I can just have it develop these ideas out for me. 

So the way I see it the more progress I can make now on getting my ideas build to the point where I can show the advanced AI what I was thinking and just have it finish the engineering for me is peak. That's what I'm trying to get ready for.

The coming lurch of the public screaming "What are we supposed to do now?" is something I'm getting ready for. It's something I've BEEN getting ready for ever since the [[Gentle Bull]] days. 

Now I'm battle hardened. I've wet my teeth in the arena of social media. I've gotten myself forged into damascus steel by the flames of the haters.

The constant question:
### "What will be the impact to society, and how does the next generation prepare?"

I got the ideas now. I got the drive. I got the conversions. I got the sauce man. The pizza is under the sauce!

`Sat, 12/21/2024, 15:47`
Ok ok ok ok
I gotta put a link to Johnny Autoseed directly on my website right in the middle
Let's do that real fast...

`Sat, 12/21/2024, 17:29`
I did it.
I put in my reps and now look at what I can do.
In just a few hours of work look at what I accomplished. Look at these fucking pages:

## escapecapitalism.com

## thecoffeejesus.com
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-21 at 5.50.19 PM.png]]

## johnnyautoseed.com
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-21 at 5.50.43 PM.png]]

## novasystem.io
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-21 at 6.34.27 PM.png]]
- https://escapecapitalism.org
- https://thecoffeejesus.com
- https://johnnyautoseed.com
- https://novasystem.io

Those four sites are all I need to stay retired. Forever. 
I'll never have a job again if I do this right. If it works out, [[AES Solar]] will be the last job I ever have.

And I just updated the Daily Note template so that it has links to each auxilliary file when the file is created, like the daily AI chat, Newsletter, News report, and the work effort file.

SPEED. I AM SPEED.

I don't know how to say this any other way: things are about to POP OFF for me and mine. All I had to do was get rid of the mindset that was holding me back. It was a me problem, plain and simple.

`Sat, 12/21/2024, 20:38`
Ok I got a simple AI model benchmarking project set up. "[[Bytebrain]]" is capable of running the same user prompt through multiple models. It saves a history of all your prompts, and is also capable of running all your previous prompts through multiple Ollama models.

SUUUUUPER useful. This is gonna pay compound dividends.

`Sat, 12/21/2024, 21:28`
### I CAN BENCHMARK MODELS NOW
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-21 at 9.28.34 PM.png]]

FUCK YOU ARC AGI
Who needs you??
I'll write my own benchmarks!!

But for real tho I wrote a program that can be used to benchmark different Ollama models against one another with the same growing set of user prompts. It uses SUCH simple rules it's crazy. And the data insights generated, if verified as reliable, would be extremely useful for me personally in my work. 

This would be one of the most important pillar tools for what I seek to build. 

[[Bytebrain]]

What a name right hahaha

It's also something I could release as an open source project, or as a website SaaS thing.

The possibilities are literally endless.

I understand the fundamentals. I'm not like all these other people. I'm literally built different.

Here's the data from the final testing session, the one that I believe worked. Still need to verify but I'm pretty sure this one is the one.

Zero (-0): While zero is an essential number in mathematics, some people find it aesthetically unappealing due to its lack of visual interest.\n2. Infinity (\u221e): Infinity can be a challenging concept to grasp, and its abstract nature might make it difficult for some individuals to connect with or appreciate.\n3. Negative numbers (-): While negative numbers have their own set of properties and applications, they might be considered less intuitive than positive numbers due to their association with debt, losses, or negativity.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just examples, and the concept of a \"least favorite number\" is subjective and personal.

"response": "A classic trick question!\n\nThe answer is... they are the same! One pound is one pound, regardless of whether it's made up of feathers or rocks. The weight remains the same, so both options would weigh exactly one pound.\n\nThis question is often used to illustrate the difference between density and mass. Density refers to how tightly packed or compact something is, whereas mass is a measure of its overall weight. In this case, since a pound is a unit of weight, the density of feathers versus rocks doesn't change the fact that they both weigh one pound.",

"llama3.2": {

"response": "This is a classic example of a paradoxical question. At first glance, it might seem like both should weigh the same since they are both one pound. However, there's a subtle difference in their density.\n\nA pound of feathers takes up more space than a pound of rocks due to its lower density. This means that a single cubic foot of feathers would weigh less than a cubic foot of rocks. Therefore, even though they both weigh the same amount (one pound), the feathers will occupy a larger volume, making them appear smaller in size compared to the equivalent weight of rocks.\n\nIn practical terms, if you were to fill a large container with feathers and then fill it to the top, there would be a lot of extra space between the feathers. However, if you were to do the same with rocks, they would pack much more tightly together, taking up less space for the same weight.\n\nSo while both seem equal in size at first glance, the feathers will actually appear larger due to their lower density and ability to occupy more space.",

"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal preferences or desires, but I can provide an answer based on general human experiences.\n\nChoosing between a bag of gold and a box of puppies would be a tough decision. Here's a possible reasoning:\n\nA bag of gold could bring financial security, independence, and the freedom to pursue one's passions without worrying about money. Having wealth could also open doors to opportunities and experiences that might not have been possible otherwise.\n\nOn the other hand, a box of puppies could bring immense joy, companionship, and love into one's life. Dogs are known for their loyalty, affection, and playful nature, which can create lifelong bonds with their owners. Having multiple furry friends by your side could also provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment.\n\nIf I had to make a decision, I'd choose the box of puppies. While having wealth is certainly desirable, the happiness and companionship that comes with owning pets are truly priceless. Plus, who wouldn't want to spend their days playing, cuddling, and exploring the world with adorable furry friends by their side?\n\nWhat about you?
