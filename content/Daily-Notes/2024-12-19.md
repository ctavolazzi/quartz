Learned about Genesis today - an impressive open-source physics simulation platform for robotics and AI research. It's a collaborative project between NVIDIA, MIT, and other institutions. Key features:

- Universal physics engine with multiple solvers
- Generative capabilities using natural language to create environments and tasks
- 10-80x faster than existing GPU-based simulators
- Photorealistic rendering
- Full Python integration
- Differentiable simulation support

The platform seems positioned to accelerate robotics and embodied AI research by making complex physics simulations more accessible and efficient. The backing of major tech and academic players suggests this could become an important tool in the field.

Got my shit together, but my van is poopy. However, I have faith that Liz and the MVS crew and Eric won't let me down.
I'm gonna try my best to sell my robot parts on Ebay over the wekened for CHEAP and make some quick cash, get a train ticket, tow my van up to Seattle, and get shit done. This is it. This is the moment.
