Learned about Genesis today - an impressive open-source physics simulation platform for robotics and AI research. It's a collaborative project between NVIDIA, MIT, and other institutions. Key features:

- Universal physics engine with multiple solvers
- Generative capabilities using natural language to create environments and tasks
- 10-80x faster than existing GPU-based simulators
- Photorealistic rendering
- Full Python integration
- Differentiable simulation support

The platform seems positioned to accelerate robotics and embodied AI research by making complex physics simulations more accessible and efficient. The backing of major tech and academic players suggests this could become an important tool in the field.

Got my shit together, but my van is poopy. However, I have faith that Liz and the MVS crew and Eric won't let me down.
I'm gonna try my best to sell my robot parts on Ebay over the wekened for CHEAP and make some quick cash, get a train ticket, tow my van up to Seattle, and get shit done. This is it. This is the moment.

Wow, the girl at the [[Bodega Pizza]] place in Chico is SO fine holy shit what the fuck.
Her name is Aleeyah (spelling?) and I'm pretty sure she's my long lost wife from another life.
Stick a fork in me I'm DONE. She looks like a sports minded person. Idk.

Dude. Genesis is fucking insane.

Simulated physics engine on your local computer, lightweight, completely written in Python

Helped [[Elo]] with his present for his lady. It's a custom Tarot card. He really did a LOT of work on it. It was super cool watching him use AI to get the results he was looking for. I got to experience the future right in front of my eyes. I feel honred, that was super fucking cool to get to give him that experience.

A lesson learned
I wasted about 3 hours today at Banshee working with CSS and fucking with some animations on a website and everything. I got really frustrated that the AI wasn't able to listen to me and follow my directions. it would get SO CLOSE then just fuck everything all the way up. it would make stuff really good and then it would just go in there and fuck up everything good it just did. It was infuriating.
Then I decided to just...give up. Just give up! What a concept!
>"NO"
My mind said.
>"YOU CANNOT GIVE UP."
Um, yes. Yes the fuck I can.
I'm not gaining anything here. I'm just spinning my wheels. So I decided that I'm gonna give up on this and just let it be what it already is, and then wait till Orion AGI comes out tomorrow and I can just pivot from web dev bullshit to hardware like everyone else.
8 days as Kayla said.
She's got the tism, I can tell. All the Banshee crew does. That's what makes them feel so much like home.

I can't be the first person out there to come up with this idea.
Throw it all in a blender, and see what sticks. Grab a physics engine, grab every supercomputer you can find, and just start doing stuff. Have an AI look over it all, choose the most desirable path, and then give it a bank account and tell it to do whatever it takes to win capitalism.
That's absolutely happening right now. And I want no part of it.
What I DO want to do is use things like 
[Genesis](https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io/) to simulate many different permutations of [[Johnny Autoseed]] to maximize crop yield over iterations in sped-up accelerated time-shifted virtual space. 
Wes Roth made a [video](https://youtu.be/IAmrSaDW88I?si=UeY-oMlG3aktuQGr)
An RTX 4090 is all you need to train robots. My home computer can run a simulation and train a robot to walk.
I said this is the year we get robots and I was fucking right.
Now it's all about getting smarter models to finish the rest of the details for me. I know enough. I'll never be able to read more than an AI. But I do have better ideas, and I think humans will always be able to adapt and have new ideas. Our special talent and skill is coming up with new ways to do things. Mostly by trial and error. Lots of iterations.
Now we can do that in virtual reality.
More importantly, AI can do it. As many times as you have computer power for.
It really is that straightforward.
It's not more or less complicated than that.
Elon has a bagillion supercomputers. NVIDIA has been doing their best to make as much progress on their small computer line and other products and services as possible. But, as always, in this industry you never know when and where the next fucking big ass player shows up to gut-punch your startup right in the balls.
So don't be the kind of sucker who gets gut-punched int he balls, fucking gut punch life first.
There's a really simple formula - take care of your body, don't drink, do hydrate and shower and floss, get a DNA gene test done and see what you're at risk for, work a chill ass job, live well within your means no matter what that takes (even live in your car if you need to), do something every day that is high leverage (coding, networking, making videos, hybrid overlap activities like making videos about coding and networking in the comments...), do it over and over every day for a really long time, never quit, just take breaks and do other things you're interested in, but always come back to the ONE THING, get really fucking good at it, and then stay the course, be consistent, never stop.
You don't have to be the best to succeed or to earn success. You just have to be as good as your next most expensive competition and then charge less.
You can absolutely 100% achieve being the best if you simply put in more time than anybody else and deliver AS GOOD as your next closest competition. 
Look for the answers to all the implied questions, but to make a point, here are some of them out loud in a list:
- Who is my closest competition?
- How do I even tell who my competition is?
- Do I want to compete in this industry? 
- What would I do if I wasn't pursuing my goals but still needed money?
- What low-impact jobs am I qualified for...
That's your list and your goals to get started.
