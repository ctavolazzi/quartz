## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Wed, 11/20/2024, 16:39`
Birthday Successfully Had. Fuck. That hurt. And then it was ok as soon as I talked to Caroline. She called me and showed me her stuffed animals and it made my heart overflow. It was a trash frog and an attached raccoon.

`Wed, 11/20/2024, 16:40`
I'm getting ready to give lecture. I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna do these. I think I might just do the morning coffee hour and then do an evening happy hour where we just hang out and decompress. Seems to be what people want. And I HATE selling shit. Fuck I hate it so much.

Talking to Caroline made me instantly feel better. That was so good I needed that desperately. I'm so glad that she called.

It's my birthday! Yay!
Automate everything! We're in the early morning coffee hour and we are vibing about automation.
I've got enough money from birthday donations now to get through the next phase of my life, and I'm good, but for the next bit I'll need to hunker down and really hit it hard. Time to grind bb. Time to grind.
What appealed to TK about [[The Multiverse School]] is that "if people like me don't get involved, then it's just gonna be tech bros who have never experienced what life is really like."
I need to figure out a way to explain it better to people > Katie said "I try to explain it to them as if it's a toddler that has access to an insane amount of information. It's just spitting out whatever comes first. It's spitting from this vast wealth of knowledge."
Tara said > "Until people have enough creative capacity to use it beyond a search engine they won't. When you go on Google and it won't give you the answer you want, you just abandon it and move on. That's not how you use AI, and unfortunately that might have to be what you have to call it right now."
Ben said > "If I ask if for something really small, like my friend's band, it will spit out exactly the description on their page, but that's because it doesn't have a lot of information to draw from."
Barb says > "From the workshop I did with the Golden Girls, I used ChatGPT to help me make up stories to help the old ladies understand. I literally used step by step things and gave them stuff to write down and do. It was amazing, they went exactly to the point where it's searching, and that's not quite it. My hope is that they understand it in the moment, and then their subconscious can do the work in the background."
Tara > "We're all using it differently, and that definitely contributes. We have therapy projects, business, everything else - AI allows you to be really specific about what you're talking about in ways that other search engines won't let you do. I've done the teaching thing and I've seen how people get overwhelmed with it. You seem to have to have a 1:1 conversation with people before they are able to really tap in and get it."
Ben > "I would expect the technology to adapt to the way people are using it, rather than people adapt to the way the tech works. I come from an art background, and I'm really sensitive to design. The iPad is a great example of incredibly good design. I've seen videos of kids in the Amazon being handed an iPad for the first time, they've never seen even a cell phone before and they can figure out how to work the iPad in seconds."

TEAM BARB! TEAM BARB!
She wants help doing the Python stuff that she doesn't have the time to build. She's interested in helping people do more good stuff, and learn more and get more done, and she's at the point where she's ready to just pay someone to do it and help her build more stuff, and she thinks the people in this community are actually trustworthy and capable. She's willing and interested in working with people in the community.

> 💭 **Prompt**: "What insights can you provide about my day?"

Based on your reflections from yesterday and the ongoing themes in your notes, a significant insight revolves around the power of intentionality in your daily routine.

### Insight:
As you embark on a new phase of content creation and personal growth, consider structuring your day around specific intentions that align with your goals. You’ve expressed a desire to cultivate an authentic online presence through platforms like YouTube and to share knowledge that empowers others. This is a powerful motivator, so harness this energy by dedicating focused blocks of time for content creation, community engagement, and personal reflection.

Creating a consistent and intentional daily rhythm can enhance your productivity. For example, you could start your day with a morning review, where you clarify your objectives for the day and set intentions for how you want to show up—both in your work and in your interactions with others. This aligns well with your previous reflections on the importance of building relationships and creating a positive impact in your community.

Moreover, as you explore creative projects like your Python game and the NovaBrew podcast, embrace the iterative nature of creativity. Allow yourself the freedom to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. This mindset will not only foster growth but also keep your creative juices flowing.

In essence, by being intentional about how you structure your day and aligning your actions with your deeper goals, you can enhance your productivity, creativity, and personal growth. This is your time to shine—keep pushing forward and embrace the journey ahead!
