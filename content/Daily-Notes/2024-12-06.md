WHAT NO WAY IT WORKED!!!?!?!?!?

Ok that changes EVERYTHING
HANG THE FUCK ON 🤪

Ok this actually really does change a lot. I can just do that, with my laptop, [[CapCut]], [[Logic Pro]], my [[Scarlett 2i2 Interface]], my [[AKG P420]] condenser mic, and an hour of my time or less. 

Holy shit. Now how do I get visuals and graphics on it quickly or free up my time from doing it...
Could I find a way to hire someone to use Midjourney to generate the images?

HMMMM

> 💭 **Prompt**: "What insights can you provide about my day?"

Today's note indicates a commitment to both reflection and forward planning, which is crucial for personal productivity and growth. Building on insights from yesterday's note, consider the progress you've made in your ongoing projects. 

As you evaluate your quarter progress today, think about how your past days' efforts align with your overall goals. Reflect on what strategies you've been employing that have worked well—perhaps your morning reviews or community engagement activities. Are there certain tasks or routines that are yielding better results? 

Incorporating a brief moment of creative brainstorming during your end-of-day reflection could help spark new ideas for your projects. This could be a great time to consider how your passion for coffee can intersect with your software development work, maybe by exploring new tech that enhances the coffee experience. 

By continuously iterating on your processes and blending your interests, you'll not only maintain productivity but also nurture your creative side, leading to more fulfilling workdays ahead.
