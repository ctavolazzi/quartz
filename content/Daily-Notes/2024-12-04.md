## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 07:55`
Today's the day :)
I'm posting my first YouTube video today!
I have to finish editing it first hahaha
>Ben: I can see a scenario where those of us that know how to use open source stuff have a responsibility and opportunity to help teach others how to use this stuff.
>I've spent so much time on this stuff doing thought experiments, and I have a real drive and clarity right now. As scary as things are, I know what to do. 

>TK: question - calling out representatives is a big chore for truckers out there behind the wheel and I feel like having an AI agent to help us with that. 

Katie showed us this site:
[https://www.seeedstudio.com/](https://www.seeedstudio.com/)

WOW that's incredible. What an amazing resource.

>Barb: you guys are the saviors of the Internet - I haven't seen anything else even close to what the Multiverse School is doing.
>Some of the boomer clients are having issues with generating income. They seem to be having trouble catching up and keeping current with the modern technology.
>I'm specifically working on coaching people to take responsibility with what they can deal with right now.
>Sometimes when you're dealing with problems, your inner child is responding, but what can the responsible adult do now for you to move past the obstacle you're having. I've been doing a lot of feelings talking for boomers. I see it as the end of the previous era, and the beginning of the technological age.

>Katie: did we trap robots in virtual reality for millions of years?

Philosophical discussion: Does AI have desires? Does it have needs?

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 09:34`
>Katie: The more you live your true life, the more pain comes up, but the more it doesn't matter. It's like acclimating to a new environment, one that's hotter or colder than what you're used to. But you eventually stop needing to many accommodations, you eventually walk outside in a snowstorm in shorts.

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 11:28`
Ok here we go again
It's the beginning of the ultimate next phase. Time to buy food and then go LIVE on YouTube again to discuss more about the MCP and the Teleport Massive game I'm building. This is so sick. We're also probably gonna talk about the [[Genie 2]] model from Google that just was announced this morning. It's a world model. Full stop.

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 11:49`
Genie 2 is incredible, and this video I just made for TikTok is gonna blow up. I'm gonna talk about it on YouTube today for my video I think...
How would I do this? Do I just...go live and then edit the video later? Do I just do that? Is that the right decision? 

I think so right...?
It's gotta be.

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 11:53`
Ok let's get some food in me and then I'll go live and start to process the Google Genie 2 paper. I'm gonna break it down on YouTube live. I'll make a YouTube short right now to promote the live and drive traffic there.

YouTube shorts now allows me to post up to 3 minutes per short?????
Ok that's the sign I've been waiting for, for SURE.

Ok let's do this. I'm going live to break down the paper and talk about the implications, and to plant my flag and start the journey. Here we go!!

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 16:56`
Ok we did it
I feel good about this flow
I will go live on YouTube and TikTok once a day for about an hour each, talking about whatever AI topic is trending that day. That way I can become top of funnel for the Multiverse School!
That's the way to widen our reach efficiently. 

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 17:41`
"What are the side effects of widespread mental health? (aka what if everyone got really healthy really fast?)"

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 19:25`
Ok ok ok ok 
I can go live and do stuff, and I can just script videos and record them. Idk. This is crazy.

`Wed, 12/04/2024, 19:29`
Remember, people are not capable of understanding abstract concepts. 1 in 5 people CANNOT think in the abstract. Only 1 out of 5 people can visualize things in their head in true fidelity.

Ok I got it done. I hated the idea of doing a Daily Recap unless it was prewritten with the AI news headlines, and now I'm on my way home to shower and do laundry and all that jazz. I am ready man. I'm doing it. This is happening.
I can have an AI algorithm script my videos for me, but I don't want to do that. I want to do the work myself, write and develop things, and then use what I'm able to do myself to work forward.

This is legit. This is happening. I'm doing it. Hell yeah!

> 💭 **Prompt**: "What insights can you provide about my day?"

Based on your reflections from yesterday and your current endeavors, a key insight revolves around **the power of community and collaboration in your creative journey**. 

1. **Community Engagement**: Your discussions about building community resource banks highlight a profound understanding of shared resources over individual ownership. This not only fosters a sense of belonging but also enhances collective problem-solving. Engaging with your community, whether through your projects or conversations, allows you to draw from diverse perspectives, which can fuel your creativity and innovation.

2. **Creative Experimentation**: Your successful implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into Teleport Massive reflects a commitment to experimentation and iteration. This willingness to test and refine your ideas is a hallmark of creativity. Embracing the process, including its challenges and surprises, can lead to breakthroughs that dramatically enhance your work.

3. **Reflection and Insight**: The depth of your reflections on societal challenges, AI’s impact, and personal experiences demonstrates a continuous cycle of learning and growth. By documenting your journey and insights, you not only clarify your thoughts but also create a wealth of material that can inspire and connect with others.

Incorporating these elements into your daily practice can augment your productivity by ensuring that you remain grounded in community and collaboration, while also nurturing your creative instincts. Keep pushing forward, celebrating the connections you build and the insights you gain along the way!
