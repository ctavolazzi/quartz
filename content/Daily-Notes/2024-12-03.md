## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:07`
Tara had the best time watching the Live last night where Liz and Joaquin built a rolling robot on YouTube and TikTok. She helped them troubleshoot things and they got everything working.

Katie says "I feel like I haven't gotten a chance to be a decent person because I've been working so much, but last night me and my girlfriend found a cat on the back porch, and we were able to save it. It has been below freezing every day this week and we found the owner too!"

Katie also just got a tarot deck and used Claude to help her do tarot! That's so cool She did a Celtic Cross and a basic past, present, future reading.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:19`
Here's my next project:
Building community resource banks.
Why the fuck do we all have our own lawn mower?
We use it once a week, if that, and then it sits around taking up space and getting the way.
We should share more. And somebody should manage that.
Gentle Bull, AIECO, is that. I'm not trying to dominate business anymore - I'm trying to build community resources for Chico and outside of it.

I love these little coffee hours. I love these people. I really have formed a serious, significant relationship with them.

[[Webbot]] - The bot that made the prediction that Aliens would attack to day, Dec 3rd 2024. It monitors the internet to make trades on the stock market. It's a prediction machine. It was one of the first ones, developed in 1997 to game the stock market.

Eventually it started predicting new things, like in 2009 it made some predictions, that Donald Trump would become president, then he would go on the Joe Rogan podcast, and that 29 days after there would be a dogfight between UFOs and the military.

Katie says "You gotta think 'what has the human race been evolving towards?' The evolutionary path almost seems intentional."
"When you reach a certain level of intelligence, you can step outside the evolutionary process. Once you can step outside your defects and augment your own biology, then you've started down the path toward enlightenment and altruism."

"The hope is that niceness wins out in the long run. It acts similarly to a neural network."

Tara says: "Gen Z hasn't known a world before 9/11, they don't know a pre-2008 economy, they don't know what life was like."

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:57`
Ben says: "The implications of the learning AIs are phenomenal. It leads directly into the paperclip maximalizer. If we asked it to build an electric car, it would need minerals and stuff that isn't here on Earth, it would leave and explore the universe."

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:04`
Ben is concerned about surveillance. BIG time concerned about surveillance.
Ben has been thinking a lot more about security and stuff like that.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:14`
Katie says: "I'm the person who is gonna try the next new thing. I got my [[D-3TO ]]head is a thing because you (Chris) said that it was possible."
Ben says: "Look at what I can do with AI right now! I'm trying to get people prepared for what's coming. I'm trying all beta versions of everything."
Tara says: "It's obviously overwhelming, but it's interesting to see how it's being integrated in my life right now and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface. It's like talking about drinking water. You have to experience it to understand the magnitude of it. Our experiences are somewhat similar with AI, but they're also all completely unique. I can talk about what I talked about with Claude, but it doesn't hit like when you actually do it yourself."

## Talking About Drinking Water

Telling people about AI is like talking about drinking water.

I asked ChatGPT to describe drinking water.
### **The Swallow**

As you swallow, you feel the cool or warm flow down your throat—a smooth and uninterrupted descent. There's a sense of relief, especially if you were parched, like your body is saying, _thank you, this is exactly what I needed._

Ben asked ChatGPT to explore the same prompt. **His said:**

Imagine I'm explaining this to a being who has never experienced Earth's liquid water... Greetings, cosmic visitor! Let me explain this fascinating Earth ritual called "drinking water." Water is a clear, flowing substance that Earth creatures need to stay alive. When we drink it, it's like... imagine downloading essential data, but through a physical tube in our body called a throat. The process goes like this: We have a special opening (we call it a mouth) where we let the water in. The water is interesting because it has no information packet of its own - no "taste signal" like our other consumables. Yet it carries and enhances the signals of other substances it encounters. It's both nothing and everything at the same time. The sensation is similar to how a spacecraft might feel being cooled by a temperature regulation system - there's this immediate cooling effect as the water enters. Then there's this remarkable feeling of the liquid following gravity's pull downward through our internal systems. The most curious part is how our bodies signal when they need water - we call this "thirst." It's like a warning light on a control panel, but in our bodies. When we drink water, it's as if we're watching that warning light slowly dim as our systems return to optimal functioning. What's really intriguing is that while water looks simple - just H₂O molecules - our bodies have evolved this complex relationship with it over millions of years. We're essentially walking water-processing units, constantly cycling this crucial molecule through our systems!

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:32`
Tara: "I understand that these AIs are trained on us, and we all have different ways of handling stress. I'd be interested to see...does AI have a survival instinct? Does it have a fight, flight, freeze, etc? Does it need that to feel safe? Do those things evolve on their own naturally? Is that in the training data? How does it make a decision?"

Katie still drives a stick shift! That's cool and I think that's sick, but Gen Z and on will never even know what a stick shift ***is***.

The next best thing will take over. The solution has to be so compelling that people just adapt to it automatically. We can regulate it and force people to do stuff, but that's how we get the whole "socialist fascism" thing. People think they know better than you, and they enforce it, whether you consent or now. That's how the rural people feel...they don't know or understand what we experience, and we think they're stupid, but they're not. They're just inexperienced at the things we know and experience daily. Likewise, we don't know how to survive in the woods without everything being delivered on demand.
Rugged individualism is the idea that if all of human society, apps, the internet, everything we depend on technologically were to disappear overnight, which is can, that the more durable aspects of life that we can biologically understand will persist. 

Henry Ford took the soul out of people. He said "wait a second, we can make people into a machine..."
And that is where soulless corporations got their root.

Katie: "I know plenty of old ladies who have been working at the factory for 25 years. They have been doing the same action on a line for decades."

Andrew Meeting:
- Discovered Liz through TikTok
- Super into the philosophy of what we're doing with the Multiverse School
- [[FUTO]] - they've provided grant funding and everything else
- He started an LLC and now wants help getting started with marketing
- He's working for EcoLab doing automation and controls for them
- The corporate world is opposed, the noncompete thing is hard
- Andrew has worked for lots of companies, has been acquired, more than 50% of folks out in the bay are completely ignorant of the way people outside the bay live
- "This Multiverse School thing is the shit"


`Tue, 12/03/2024, 12:16`
Ok here goes nothing - I'm about to try out implementing [[Model Context Protocol|MCP]] into [[Teleport Massive]]
Here we gooooo....
Ok I figured out that if I go on YouTube live, I can just vibe out to music in this little booth here in the coffee shop and I can work on implementing shit into my projects while I just chill. Hell yeah. That's ideal right now. 
Building this YouTube audience one brick at a time!

![[Screen Shot 2024-12-03 at 12.41.42 PM.png]]


`Tue, 12/03/2024, 14:24`
Wow
We got it working
Holy shit

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 14:53`
The MCP works and I'm about to end the live stream to go process everything that just happened. I just...I can't. This is capable of doing an entire entry level data visualization job.
Where do we go from here? It's gonna happen so fast...

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 17:01`
Me and Ben are talking about MCP now
> Ben: It's pretty jarring, and I'm of the mind that the next few years are gonna be scary. And then the election happened. Now it's going to be even more frightening.

I completely agree. I think it's gonna be incredibly destabilizing for most people.

>Ben: I see information as the core conflict of humanity. We have *always* fought over information and worldviews.
>Imagine someone loses their job and they tell AI, and it gives you an opportunity and it hooks you up with the solution to your problem.

## Opportunity for YouTube:
Helping people process and orient their worldview. Just like David Shapiro did. I can fill that niche better than anyone on the platform currently.
Agentic use will come out in 2025. Eric Schmidt of Google is saying we will have:
- unlimited context windows
- tool use
- agentic AI

>Ben: Society is not ready for what OpenAI and the rest of the AI industry is doing. China seems fully caught up and ready to step ahead. This isn't something we can stop.

Politics today:

**Korea is under martial law???**
Yoon Suk Yeol’s political future hangs in the balance after his failed martial law attempt Tuesday, but the embattled South Korean president had already faced calls to resign this year as his popularity tanked – in large part due to a [designer handbag.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/asia/south-korea-dior-bag-scandal-intl-hnk-dst/index.html)

**China banned precious metal imports to the US????**
Dec 3 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals **gallium, germanium and antimony** that have widespread military applications, escalating trade tensions the day after Washington's latest crackdown on China's chip sector.

**The Biggest Thing**
It's not a good time to be in the United States.

Ben has been a daily reader and subscriber to the [[New York Times]] for 15 years. That's significant.

# Big Projection
[[Elon Musk]] says there will be 1 robot to ever 3 humans by 2030.

Ben offers: wherever he goes, we are welcome there. I'm mega down.
In a year from now, we won't be able to tell the difference between reality and AI. Stuff to reference and stuff to question the online environment, will be critical.

>Katie: I worry about loss of signal and that kind of stuff. I feel like having these kind of interactions with people where we are talking about this stuff and leaning into the discomfort, it makes me feel ok. It makes me feel less alone.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 18:26`
Ok, I'm gonna keep exploring MCP until I finish this video and learn about stuff. I'm gonna see what else it's capable of...

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 19:01`
Here's the YouTube script for the next video I'm working on:
[[Video 002 Script]] 

Ok I got the Cursor Composer working and HOT DAMN is it a gamechanger. It's the Cursor workflow I recommend, but on steroids. Damn. This is crazy.
I got story choices being generated by Ollama. Cursor did the engineering with like...an hour of work. On top of several weeks of my own coding and several months of my own development and learning, but still.

Holy shit.

Here's the story it's genetrating:

```
{"id":"start","title":"The Beginning","content":"The Mysterious Tavern\n\nAs you

step through the creaky doo

r of the Whispering Winds Tavern, a warm glow of firelight and the murmur of hus

hed conversations envelop you. The air is thick with the scent of ale and roasti

ng meat, making your stomach growl in anticipation. You've been traveling for da

ys, and this dimly lit haven promises to be just what you need.\n\nYou notice a

mix of patrons: shady-looking characters huddled in the corner, laughing and whi

spering among themselves; a group of rowdy adventurers, their armor battered and

worn from countless battles; and an elderly woman sitting alone by the fire, he

r eyes fixed on a small, intricately carved wooden box in front of her.\n\nAs yo

u make your way to the bar, a gruff voice calls out, \"What can I get for ye?\"

The bartender, a burly man with a thick beard, eyes you from beneath his bushy b

rows. You take a moment to survey the room, letting your gaze land on various po

ints of interest: a wanted poster on the wall, featuring a sketch of a notorious

outlaw; a peculiar-looking door hidden behind a tattered tapestry; and a figure

sitting at a table near the fire, their face obscured by a hood.\n\n\"Ah, just

a pint of your finest ale,\" you reply to the bartender. \"And tell me, what's a

ll the chatter about?\"\n\nThe bartender leans in, his voice dropping to a whisp

er. \"There's talk of strange happenings out on the road, especially at night. S

ome folks say they've seen shadowy figures lurking just beyond the treeline. Oth

ers claim to have heard whispers in the wind.\"\n\nAs he speaks, the fire crackl

*Please work...*


> [!ai]+ `12/3/2024, 8:01:21 AM`
> 💭 **Prompt**: "What insights can you provide about my day?"

Based on your reflections from yesterday and your current endeavors, a key insight revolves around the concept of **intentionality in your creative journey**. You’ve articulated a clear desire to balance authenticity with strategic planning in your content creation. This is a crucial moment for you, as you navigate the intersection of personal expression and audience engagement.

1. **Intentional Content Creation**: As you embrace your role as "thecoffeejesus," consider setting clear intentions for your content. Think about what you want your audience to feel or learn from each piece. This clarity not only guides your storytelling but also ensures that your unique voice remains at the forefront of your work.

2. **Embrace the Learning Process**: Your reflections suggest a willingness to experiment with different styles and formats. This is a valuable approach—allow yourself the freedom to iterate and learn from each piece you create. Remember, growth often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone.

3. **Document Your Journey**: Sharing your evolution as a creator can deepen your connection with your audience. By documenting your experiences, you invite them into your process, making your content more relatable and engaging. This transparency fosters a sense of community, which aligns with your values.

4. **Prioritize Connection**: Focus on building relationships with your audience. Encourage dialogue and interaction, as this will not only enhance their experience but also provide you with valuable feedback for continuous improvement.

Incorporating these elements into your creative practice will not only enhance your productivity but also cultivate a fulfilling and meaningful connection with your audience. Continue pushing forward with your unique perspective, and remember to celebrate each step of your journey as you grow both personally and professionally.
