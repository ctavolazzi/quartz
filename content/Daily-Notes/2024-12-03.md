## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:07`
Tara had the best time watching the Live last night where Liz and Joaquin built a rolling robot on YouTube and TikTok. She helped them troubleshoot things and they got everything working.

Katie says "I feel like I haven't gotten a chance to be a decent person because I've been working so much, but last night me and my girlfriend found a cat on the back porch, and we were able to save it. It has been below freezing every day this week and we found the owner too!"

Katie also just got a tarot deck and used Claude to help her do tarot! That's so cool She did a Celtic Cross and a basic past, present, future reading.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:19`
Here's my next project:
Building community resource banks.
Why the fuck do we all have our own lawn mower?
We use it once a week, if that, and then it sits around taking up space and getting the way.
We should share more. And somebody should manage that.
Gentle Bull, AIECO, is that. I'm not trying to dominate business anymore - I'm trying to build community resources for Chico and outside of it.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:22`
I love these little coffee hours. I love these people. I really have formed a serious, significant relationship with them.

[[Webbot]] - The bot that made the prediction that Aliens would attack to day, Dec 3rd 2024. It monitors the internet to make trades on the stock market. It's a prediction machine. It was one of the first ones, developed in 1997 to game the stock market.

Eventually it started predicting new things, like in 2009 it made some predictions, that Donald Trump would become president, then he would go on the Joe Rogan podcast, and that 29 days after there would be a dogfight between UFOs and the military.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:42`
Katie says "You gotta think 'what has the human race been evolving towards?' The evolutionary path almost seems intentional."
"When you reach a certain level of intelligence, you can step outside the evolutionary process. Once you can step outside your defects and augment your own biology, then you've started down the path toward enlightenment and altruism."

"The hope is that niceness wins out in the long run. It acts similarly to a neural network."

Tara says: "Gen Z hasn't known a world before 9/11, they don't know a pre-2008 economy, they don't know what life was like."

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:57`
Ben says: "The implications of the learning AIs are phenomenal. It leads directly into the paperclip maximalizer. If we asked it to build an electric car, it would need minerals and stuff that isn't here on Earth, it would leave and explore the universe."

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:04`
Ben is concerned about surveillance. BIG time concerned about surveillance.
Ben has been thinking a lot more about security and stuff like that.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:14`
Katie says: "I'm the person who is gonna try the next new thing. I got my [[D-3TO ]]head is a thing because you (Chris) said that it was possible."
Ben says: "Look at what I can do with AI right now! I'm trying to get people prepared for what's coming. I'm trying all beta versions of everything."
Tara says: "It's obviously overwhelming, but it's interesting to see how it's being integrated in my life right now and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface. It's like talking about drinking water. You have to experience it to understand the magnitude of it. Our experiences are somewhat similar with AI, but they're also all completely unique. I can talk about what I talked about with Claude, but it doesn't hit like when you actually do it yourself."

## Talking About Drinking Water

Telling people about AI is like talking about drinking water.

I asked ChatGPT to describe drinking water.
### **The Swallow**

As you swallow, you feel the cool or warm flow down your throat—a smooth and uninterrupted descent. There's a sense of relief, especially if you were parched, like your body is saying, _thank you, this is exactly what I needed._

Ben asked ChatGPT to explore the same prompt. **His said:**

Imagine I'm explaining this to a being who has never experienced Earth's liquid water... Greetings, cosmic visitor! Let me explain this fascinating Earth ritual called "drinking water." Water is a clear, flowing substance that Earth creatures need to stay alive. When we drink it, it's like... imagine downloading essential data, but through a physical tube in our body called a throat. The process goes like this: We have a special opening (we call it a mouth) where we let the water in. The water is interesting because it has no information packet of its own - no "taste signal" like our other consumables. Yet it carries and enhances the signals of other substances it encounters. It's both nothing and everything at the same time. The sensation is similar to how a spacecraft might feel being cooled by a temperature regulation system - there's this immediate cooling effect as the water enters. Then there's this remarkable feeling of the liquid following gravity's pull downward through our internal systems. The most curious part is how our bodies signal when they need water - we call this "thirst." It's like a warning light on a control panel, but in our bodies. When we drink water, it's as if we're watching that warning light slowly dim as our systems return to optimal functioning. What's really intriguing is that while water looks simple - just H₂O molecules - our bodies have evolved this complex relationship with it over millions of years. We're essentially walking water-processing units, constantly cycling this crucial molecule through our systems!

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:32`
Tara: "I understand that these AIs are trained on us, and we all have different ways of handling stress. I'd be interested to see...does AI have a survival instinct? Does it have a fight, flight, freeze, etc? Does it need that to feel safe? Do those things evolve on their own naturally? Is that in the training data? How does it make a decision?"

Katie still drives a stick shift! That's cool and I think that's sick, but Gen Z and on will never even know what a stick shift ***is***.

The next best thing will take over. The solution has to be so compelling that people just adapt to it automatically. We can regulate it and force people to do stuff, but that's how we get the whole "socialist fascism" thing. People think they know better than you, and they enforce it, whether you consent or now. That's how the rural people feel...they don't know or understand what we experience, and we think they're stupid, but they're not. They're just inexperienced at the things we know and experience daily. Likewise, we don't know how to survive in the woods without everything being delivered on demand.
Rugged individualism is the idea that if all of human society, apps, the internet, everything we depend on technologically were to disappear overnight, which is can, that the more durable aspects of life that we can biologically understand will persist. 

Henry Ford took the soul out of people. He said "wait a second, we can make people into a machine..."
And that is where soulless corporations got their root.

Katie: "I know plenty of old ladies who have been working at the factory for 25 years. They have been doing the same action on a line for decades."

Andrew Meeting:
- Discovered Liz through TikTok
- Super into the philosophy of what we're doing with the Multiverse School
- [[FUTO]] - they've provided grant funding and everything else
- He started an LLC and now wants help getting started with marketing
- He's working for EcoLab doing automation and controls for them
- The corporate world is opposed, the noncompete thing is hard
- Andrew has worked for lots of companies, has been acquired, more than 50% of folks out in the bay are completely ignorant of the way people outside the bay live
- "This Multiverse School thing is the shit"


`Tue, 12/03/2024, 12:16`
Ok here goes nothing - I'm about to try out implementing [[Model Context Protocol|MCP]] into [[Teleport Massive]]
Here we gooooo....
Ok I figured out that if I go on YouTube live, I can just vibe out to music in this little booth here in the coffee shop and I can work on implementing shit into my projects while I just chill. Hell yeah. That's ideal right now. 
Building this YouTube audience one brick at a time!

![[Screen Shot 2024-12-03 at 12.41.42 PM.png]]


`Tue, 12/03/2024, 14:24`
Wow
We got it working
Holy shit

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 14:53`
The MCP works and I'm about to end the live stream to go process everything that just happened. I just...I can't. This is capable of doing an entire entry level data visualization job.
Where do we go from here? It's gonna happen so fast...

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 17:01`
Me and Ben are talking about MCP now
> Ben: It's pretty jarring, and I'm of the mind that the next few years are gonna be scary. And then the election happened. Now it's going to be even more frightening.

I completely agree. I think it's gonna be incredibly destabilizing for most people.

>Ben: I see information as the core conflict of humanity. We have *always* fought over information and worldviews.
>Imagine someone loses their job and they tell AI, and it gives you an opportunity and it hooks you up with the solution to your problem.

## Opportunity for YouTube:
Helping people process and orient their worldview. Just like David Shapiro did. I can fill that niche better than anyone on the platform currently.
Agentic use will come out in 2025. Eric Schmidt of Google is saying we will have:
- unlimited context windows
- tool use
- agentic AI

>Ben: Society is not ready for what OpenAI and the rest of the AI industry is doing. China seems fully caught up and ready to step ahead. This isn't something we can stop.

Politics today:

**Korea is under martial law???**
Yoon Suk Yeol’s political future hangs in the balance after his failed martial law attempt Tuesday, but the embattled South Korean president had already faced calls to resign this year as his popularity tanked – in large part due to a [designer handbag.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/asia/south-korea-dior-bag-scandal-intl-hnk-dst/index.html)

**China banned precious metal imports to the US????**
Dec 3 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals **gallium, germanium and antimony** that have widespread military applications, escalating trade tensions the day after Washington's latest crackdown on China's chip sector.

**The Biggest Thing**
It's not a good time to be in the United States.

Ben has been a daily reader and subscriber to the [[New York Times]] for 15 years. That's significant.

# Big Projection
[[Elon Musk]] says there will be 1 robot to ever 3 humans by 2030.

Ben offers: wherever he goes, we are welcome there. I'm mega down.
In a year from now, we won't be able to tell the difference between reality and AI. Stuff to reference and stuff to question the online environment, will be critical.

>Katie: I worry about loss of signal and that kind of stuff. I feel like having these kind of interactions with people where we are talking about this stuff and leaning into the discomfort, it makes me feel ok. It makes me feel less alone.

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 18:26`
Ok, I'm gonna keep exploring MCP until I finish this video and learn about stuff. I'm gonna see what else it's capable of...

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 19:01`
Here's the YouTube script for the next video I'm working on:
[[Video 002 Script]] 

Ok I got the Cursor Composer working and HOT DAMN is it a gamechanger. It's the Cursor workflow I recommend, but on steroids. Damn. This is crazy.
I got story choices being generated by Ollama. Cursor did the engineering with like...an hour of work. On top of several weeks of my own coding and several months of my own development and learning, but still.

Holy shit.

Here's the story it's genetrating:

```
{"id":"start","title":"The Beginning","content":"The Mysterious Tavern\n\nAs you

step through the creaky doo

ys, and this dimly lit haven promises to be just what you need.\n\nYou notice a

mix of patrons: shady-looking characters huddled in the corner, laughing and whi

The bartender, a burly man with a thick beard, eyes you from beneath his bushy b

rows. You take a moment to survey the room, letting your gaze land on various po

ints of interest: a wanted poster on the wall, featuring a sketch of a notorious

outlaw; a peculiar-looking door hidden behind a tattered tapestry; and a figure

sitting at a table near the fire, their face obscured by a hood.\n\n\"Ah, just

a pint of your finest ale,\" you reply to the bartender. \"And tell me, what's a

Based on your reflections from yesterday and your current endeavors, a key insight revolves around the concept of **intentionality in your creative journey**. You’ve articulated a clear desire to balance authenticity with strategic planning in your content creation. This is a crucial moment for you, as you navigate the intersection of personal expression and audience engagement.

1. **Intentional Content Creation**: As you embrace your role as "thecoffeejesus," consider setting clear intentions for your content. Think about what you want your audience to feel or learn from each piece. This clarity not only guides your storytelling but also ensures that your unique voice remains at the forefront of your work.

2. **Embrace the Learning Process**: Your reflections suggest a willingness to experiment with different styles and formats. This is a valuable approach—allow yourself the freedom to iterate and learn from each piece you create. Remember, growth often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone.

3. **Document Your Journey**: Sharing your evolution as a creator can deepen your connection with your audience. By documenting your experiences, you invite them into your process, making your content more relatable and engaging. This transparency fosters a sense of community, which aligns with your values.

🎬 Starting new story generation...


================================================================================

📖 The Beginning

The sun had just begun to set on the small town of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and buildings. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the sound of children's laughter carried from the nearby park.

You stood outside the local tavern, its wooden sign creaking in the gentle breeze. The sign bore the image of a golden raven perched atop a mug, surrounded by the words "The Raven's Rest." You had arrived in Ravenshire just a day ago, and already you felt like an outsider. As a skilled thief and scoundrel, you were used to keeping a low profile, but there was something about this town that drew you in.

You pushed open the door and stepped inside, your eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The tavern was bustling with patrons, their faces a blur of curiosity and suspicion. You spotted the bard in the corner, his lute slung over his shoulder as he strummed a lively tune on his instrument. Next to him sat a hooded figure, sipping a mug of ale with an air of quiet intensity.

As you made your way to the bar, a gruff voice behind you said, "New face in town, eh?" You turned to see a burly man with a thick beard and a scowl on his face. He eyed you up and down before adding, "Welcome to Ravenshire. I'm Grimbold Ironfist. What brings you to our humble abode?"

The bartender, a friendly woman with a warm smile, greeted you with a welcoming pat on the back. "What can I get for you, stranger? Ale or whiskey?"

You took in your surroundings, weighing your options.

Available choices:
1. Ask Grimbold about the hooded figure
2. Order a drink and listen to the bard's music
3. Inquire about the local rumors and gossip
4. Take a seat by yourself, observing the patrons

📖 Chapter 1

You smiled warmly at Grimbold's gruff demeanor and replied, "Just a ale, please. And if I might be so bold, what's the story behind this fine establishment?" You nodded toward The Raven's Rest sign, your eyes scanning the room for any signs of hidden meaning.

Grimbold snorted, his scowl deepening before he said, "Ah, you're one of those city folk who thinks they can just waltz into a town and make friends with everyone. Well, I'll tell you this, stranger: Ravenshire's got its secrets. But if you're lucky, we might share 'em with you."

As Grimbold spoke, the bard's music reached a crescendo, weaving in and out of the tavern's laughter and chatter. The hooded figure beside him seemed entranced by the sound, their eyes closed as if lost in the melody.

The bartender handed you a foamy mug of ale, saying, "Grimbold can be...prickly, but he means well. Now, what brings you to Ravenshire? You're not from around here, that's for sure."

You took a sip of your ale, feeling the cool liquid slide down your throat as you scanned the room once more.

As you sipped, you noticed something peculiar: the tavern's patrons were all staring at you – or rather, at the stranger with the new face. The air seemed to thicken with an unspoken question: "Who are you?" and what did they want?

Available choices:
1. Ask Grimbold directly about the townspeople's gaze
2. Strike up a conversation with the hooded figure
3. Take a closer look at the tavern's decorations

📖 Chapter 2

You set your mug down on the worn wooden table, catching Grimbold's gaze as you nodded toward the hooded figure. "That one, I think," you said, nodding discreetly toward the entranced stranger. The bartender, a stout woman with a kind face and a mop of curly brown hair, leaned in, intrigued.

"Ah, you mean Lyra?" she whispered. "She's been here for...a while. Been staying at the inn on the outskirts of town. She doesn't say much to anyone, but there's something about her that draws people in."

Grimbold snorted again, this time with a hint of amusement. "Lyra's got secrets, all right. But she's not one for sharing them with just anyone." His eyes flicked back to you, his expression softening ever so slightly. "Still, if you're interested...I can introduce you."

You nodded, sensing an opportunity to unravel the mystery surrounding Lyra. As Grimbold gestured toward her, Lyra slowly opened her eyes, her gaze locking onto yours with an unnerving intensity.

The music from the bard had stopped, and for a moment, there was only the sound of your mutual regard. The air felt charged with anticipation.

Lyra pushed back her hood, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into your very soul. Her skin was deathly pale, almost translucent in the firelight, and her hair cascaded down her back like dark silk.

"Welcome," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been waiting."

The tavern's patrons watched with rapt attention, their faces a mix of curiosity and suspicion. Grimbold leaned against his bar, arms crossed, as if daring anyone to intervene.

Available choices:
1. Ask Lyra what she means by "waiting"
2. Try to engage the other patrons in conversation
3. Inquire about the local rumors and legends

📖 Chapter 3

As Lyra's gaze held yours, you felt a shiver run down your spine. The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows on the walls, and the air was heavy with anticipation. You took a deep breath, trying to compose yourself, and asked, "Rumors and legends, then? What brings you here?"

Lyra's eyes seemed to gleam in the firelight, her pupils dilating as she leaned forward. "The old stories," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the din of the tavern. "The whispers of the forest, the ancient ones who slumber beneath our feet. There are those who claim to have seen the Shadow Walker, a figure from tales told 'round campfires and in hushed whispers."

Grimbold snorted again, but his tone was more curious than dismissive now. "Ah, don't believe everything you hear," he cautioned. "Most of it's just small-town gossip."

Lyra smiled, her lips curving upward in a subtle smile. "Some truths are better served with a grain of salt," she said, her eyes sparkling with mirth. "But I think there's more to these stories than mere fantasy. There's something...alive about them, don't you think?"

The patrons of the tavern seemed entranced by Lyra's words, their faces aglow with curiosity and suspicion. The bard, who had been quietly observing the scene, began to strum a new melody on his lute, one that sent shivers down your spine.

Suddenly, the door creaked open, admitting a gust of cold air and a figure cloaked in darkness. The figure moved swiftly, weaving between tables as if seeking refuge from the chill outside.

Lyra's eyes snapped toward the newcomer, her gaze narrowing as she watched them. "Ah," she breathed softly, "looks like we've got company."

Available choices:
1. Ask Lyra about the mysterious figure
2. Approach the cloaked figure, sensing potential danger or intrigue
3. Take a sip of your drink, observing the scene unfold before you

📖 Chapter 4

As you rose from your seat, the fire crackling behind you, Lyra's eyes never left the cloaked figure. You felt a shiver run down your spine, sensing that this newcomer might be more than just a chilly gust of wind. The bard's music seemed to falter for a moment, as if he too sensed the undercurrents in play.

You approached the cloaked figure, the patrons parting to reveal a tall, slender woman with skin as white as the moon and hair as black as the night. Her features were shrouded in shadows, making it impossible to discern any defining characteristics. She moved swiftly, her eyes scanning the tavern as if searching for something or someone.

"Greetings," you said softly, trying not to startle her further. "Welcome to our humble tavern."

The woman's gaze locked onto yours, and for an instant, you felt like she was seeing right through you. Her eyes were piercing, like stars on a moonless night. Then, with a subtle nod, she vanished into the crowd.

Lyra leaned forward, her voice barely audible over the din of conversation. "Ah, that's Kaida," she whispered. "A traveler from afar, rumored to be searching for... something."

The bard's music began again, this time with an air of mystery and foreboding. The patrons seemed entranced by Lyra's words, their faces aglow with curiosity.

As you pondered the meaning behind Lyra's enigmatic comment, Kaida reappeared at your side, her eyes fixed intently on yours. "Can I trust that I speak to someone who might... understand?" she asked, her voice low and husky.

Available choices:
1. [Listen carefully to Kaida's words]
2. [Ask Lyra about Kaida's past]
3. [Turn to Grimbold for guidance]
