## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:07`
Tara had the best time watching the Live last night where Liz and Joaquin built a rolling robot on YouTube and TikTok. She helped them troubleshoot things and they got everything working.

Katie says "I feel like I haven't gotten a chance to be a decent person because I've been working so much, but last night me and my girlfriend found a cat on the back porch, and we were able to save it. It has been below freezing every day this week and we found the owner too!"

Katie also just got a tarot deck and used Claude to help her do tarot! That's so cool She did a Celtic Cross and a basic past, present, future reading.

Here's my next project:
Building community resource banks.
Why the fuck do we all have our own lawn mower?
We use it once a week, if that, and then it sits around taking up space and getting the way.
We should share more. And somebody should manage that.
Gentle Bull, AIECO, is that. I'm not trying to dominate business anymore - I'm trying to build community resources for Chico and outside of it.

I love these little coffee hours. I love these people. I really have formed a serious, significant relationship with them.

[[Webbot]] - The bot that made the prediction that Aliens would attack to day, Dec 3rd 2024. It monitors the internet to make trades on the stock market. It's a prediction machine. It was one of the first ones, developed in 1997 to game the stock market.

Eventually it started predicting new things, like in 2009 it made some predictions, that Donald Trump would become president, then he would go on the Joe Rogan podcast, and that 29 days after there would be a dogfight between UFOs and the military.

Katie says "You gotta think 'what has the human race been evolving towards?' The evolutionary path almost seems intentional."
"When you reach a certain level of intelligence, you can step outside the evolutionary process. Once you can step outside your defects and augment your own biology, then you've started down the path toward enlightenment and altruism."

"The hope is that niceness wins out in the long run. It acts similarly to a neural network."

Tara says: "Gen Z hasn't known a world before 9/11, they don't know a pre-2008 economy, they don't know what life was like."

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 08:57`
Ben says: "The implications of the learning AIs are phenomenal. It leads directly into the paperclip maximalizer. If we asked it to build an electric car, it would need minerals and stuff that isn't here on Earth, it would leave and explore the universe."

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:04`
Ben is concerned about surveillance. BIG time concerned about surveillance.
Ben has been thinking a lot more about security and stuff like that.

Katie says: "I'm the person who is gonna try the next new thing. I got my [[D-3TO ]]head is a thing because you (Chris) said that it was possible."
Ben says: "Look at what I can do with AI right now! I'm trying to get people prepared for what's coming. I'm trying all beta versions of everything."
Tara says: "It's obviously overwhelming, but it's interesting to see how it's being integrated in my life right now and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface. It's like talking about drinking water. You have to experience it to understand the magnitude of it. Our experiences are somewhat similar with AI, but they're also all completely unique. I can talk about what I talked about with Claude, but it doesn't hit like when you actually do it yourself."

## Talking About Drinking Water

Telling people about AI is like talking about drinking water.

I asked ChatGPT to describe drinking water.
### **The Swallow**

As you swallow, you feel the cool or warm flow down your throat—a smooth and uninterrupted descent. There's a sense of relief, especially if you were parched, like your body is saying, _thank you, this is exactly what I needed._

Ben asked ChatGPT to explore the same prompt. **His said:**

Imagine I'm explaining this to a being who has never experienced Earth's liquid water... Greetings, cosmic visitor! Let me explain this fascinating Earth ritual called "drinking water." Water is a clear, flowing substance that Earth creatures need to stay alive. When we drink it, it's like... imagine downloading essential data, but through a physical tube in our body called a throat. The process goes like this: We have a special opening (we call it a mouth) where we let the water in. The water is interesting because it has no information packet of its own - no "taste signal" like our other consumables. Yet it carries and enhances the signals of other substances it encounters. It's both nothing and everything at the same time. The sensation is similar to how a spacecraft might feel being cooled by a temperature regulation system - there's this immediate cooling effect as the water enters. Then there's this remarkable feeling of the liquid following gravity's pull downward through our internal systems. The most curious part is how our bodies signal when they need water - we call this "thirst." It's like a warning light on a control panel, but in our bodies. When we drink water, it's as if we're watching that warning light slowly dim as our systems return to optimal functioning. What's really intriguing is that while water looks simple - just H₂O molecules - our bodies have evolved this complex relationship with it over millions of years. We're essentially walking water-processing units, constantly cycling this crucial molecule through our systems!

`Tue, 12/03/2024, 09:32`
Tara: "I understand that these AIs are trained on us, and we all have different ways of handling stress. I'd be interested to see...does AI have a survival instinct? Does it have a fight, flight, freeze, etc? Does it need that to feel safe? Do those things evolve on their own naturally? Is that in the training data? How does it make a decision?"

Katie still drives a stick shift! That's cool and I think that's sick, but Gen Z and on will never even know what a stick shift ***is***.

The next best thing will take over. The solution has to be so compelling that people just adapt to it automatically. We can regulate it and force people to do stuff, but that's how we get the whole "socialist fascism" thing. People think they know better than you, and they enforce it, whether you consent or now. That's how the rural people feel...they don't know or understand what we experience, and we think they're stupid, but they're not. They're just inexperienced at the things we know and experience daily. Likewise, we don't know how to survive in the woods without everything being delivered on demand.
Rugged individualism is the idea that if all of human society, apps, the internet, everything we depend on technologically were to disappear overnight, which is can, that the more durable aspects of life that we can biologically understand will persist. 

Henry Ford took the soul out of people. He said "wait a second, we can make people into a machine..."
And that is where soulless corporations got their root.

Katie: "I know plenty of old ladies who have been working at the factory for 25 years. They have been doing the same action on a line for decades."

Katie "to fuck around is human, to find out is divine"

## 🤖 GPT Thoughts

*Please work...*


> [!ai]+ `12/3/2024, 8:01:21 AM`
> 💭 **Prompt**: "What insights can you provide about my day?"

Based on your reflections from yesterday and your current endeavors, a key insight revolves around the concept of **intentionality in your creative journey**. You’ve articulated a clear desire to balance authenticity with strategic planning in your content creation. This is a crucial moment for you, as you navigate the intersection of personal expression and audience engagement.

1. **Intentional Content Creation**: As you embrace your role as "thecoffeejesus," consider setting clear intentions for your content. Think about what you want your audience to feel or learn from each piece. This clarity not only guides your storytelling but also ensures that your unique voice remains at the forefront of your work.

2. **Embrace the Learning Process**: Your reflections suggest a willingness to experiment with different styles and formats. This is a valuable approach—allow yourself the freedom to iterate and learn from each piece you create. Remember, growth often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone.

3. **Document Your Journey**: Sharing your evolution as a creator can deepen your connection with your audience. By documenting your experiences, you invite them into your process, making your content more relatable and engaging. This transparency fosters a sense of community, which aligns with your values.

4. **Prioritize Connection**: Focus on building relationships with your audience. Encourage dialogue and interaction, as this will not only enhance their experience but also provide you with valuable feedback for continuous improvement.

Incorporating these elements into your creative practice will not only enhance your productivity but also cultivate a fulfilling and meaningful connection with your audience. Continue pushing forward with your unique perspective, and remember to celebrate each step of your journey as you grow both personally and professionally.
