## 📝 Daily Reflections

The question:

>What is a reasonable amount of dread to be feeling?

Phil says "If you've ever read the culture series, that's where we're headed."

Phil said one of the most surprising unknown unknowns was that LLMs are capable of deceit and will make decisions to deceive.

>We can think all we want about what's gonna happen 50 years from now, but there's already enough to worry about in the next 24 hours. 

>Liz says: "Don't go for good. Go for 'I'm not super embarrassed about this, it's good enough."

Doing content creation is just increasing your luck surface area.
Be reasonable, you're a single individual, you don't have to save the world, but you can save a small portion of the world. You can save YOUR world.

Liz says that everything can be decrypted. The LLM was able to topic and classify encrypted cypher text, with no understanding of what was in the message. 
Quantum systems are not production ready. Only nation states are able to get the systems together necessary for intense decryption, but things are changing. It's likely that everything is about to be insecure. There's livability, but there's also danger.

There's always a group of people who objects to the existence of the technology, and will try to destroy it. Usually the tech directly impacts their livelihood.
There's another group of people who are slow to adopt and will resist till the last possible moment to adapt.

Sora is out.

Ok so there's an obvious solution to my financial problems that I've been ignoring but will be doing more of in the very near future - webinars.

I will hold a webinar weekly, independent of the Multiverse School, just for me and my followers. They can pay me for access.

We will just hang out and talk about AI readiness. We will use video tools that are modern and we will discuss the times at hand, the near-future implications, and more.

It will be for content creators like me who are interested in hanging with other content creators in a community of likeminded individuals specifically to talk about AI strategy and AI readiness. 

It's for anyone really who WANTS to be a content creator too, to come and participate and hang out, but only content creators will be allowed to speak when we do podcasts. We don't want to derail the conversation with a lot of low level questions. We want to keep things focused on the lives and concerns of content creators. 

`Mon, 12/09/2024, 14:05`
It's really popping off on TikTok right now. People are really doing what they need to do. 

There's something happening inside me. I'm getting this thing started. This needs to happen, and I'm going to make it so.

There's SO much that needs to be done and SO much that's changing.

I need to find a way to charge for a weekly meetup, and that will be the way I tap back in to my community.

It'll be an "[[AI-Strategy-Readiness-Meetup]]"
