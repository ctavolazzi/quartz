## 📝 Daily Reflections

I really like making money for doing nothing. This is actually great. 

So far I've had 2 bookings come and go with both not showing up and not conforming by email. They purchased the booking, and that was it.
I'm going to make a policy page for my site so that the legal stuff is clear. It'll be a link near the buttons to buy that is a disclaimer that they are purchasing the booking, at the time slot they select, and that's it. If they want to reschedule they can contact me to do so but if they miss their appointment slot I will be under no obligation to reimburse them. No refunds. If I show up and they don't arrive in the meeting or show up within 10 minutes or contact me during the first 10 minutes after the meeting was supposed to start then I will leave the meeting room and they will then need to contact me to reschedule. They may be reuired to rebook through my website and pay for another time slot, but Christopher Tavolazzi (me) reserves the right to waive the rebooking fee or offer a refund or something of similar value at his discretion. They are buying the time slot and if they don't show up or contact me within the first 10 minutes I will leave the room. I think that's fair.

Added a disclaimer to my site for protection. Did it it looks good :)

Now I'm adjusting the offerings. I'm tweaking the descriptions to address confusion people have already expressed.

Look at what I made! i feel proud of it:

I think that looks good and will sell. I just want to help people, but food and life costs money. So I must charge. And I'm finally ok with it. I feel like I earned it now. I worked my fucking ass off. My body HURTS. It was worth it. Look at what I was able to make :)

I feel creative and artistic and happy. 
Your heart doesn't lie. My heart feels peace. I can just do what I do and earn money by passively offering my time for hire.

This is everything.

Justen Willis Meeting
He's seen me and has a parasocial relationship with me.

> "Most people who come to me with questions."

- Engineer
- "I have a while before that's a problem."
- Engineer with AudHD - my bread and butter :) that and old ladies they both love me
- Can I get him in the Multiverse? AI Coffee? $60 a month. 
- "We were all in the gifted program, we all had the same psychological profile, the same mental issues, and now we have taught each other how to handle things."
- "I am aware of everybody's shit, and I have been in observe mode, and I'm working on how to propose my idea to the masses."
- Had 1400 people apply for a job that didn't exist. He did an intake form.
- He's just like me wow
- Wants to build something called "Unity Consciousness"
- Wants to iterate over problems with a cellular replication model to solve societal problems.
- He's [[@mindfullyabundant]]
- AWS is about to have steep competition with HollowChain
- What is Hollow Chain? I need to look that up and go deep on that one. Seems like a great way to solve the cloud problem. Decentralized everything.
- "I think data is the new oil."
- "It's not gonna be individuals working toward monetary means, it's gonna be us collectively working on solutions to problems."
- He wants to create a digital clone of yourself, so that you can share what you learn with the collective. 
- He wants to privatize the personal data, but empower the individual to create KPIs for problems 
- AI can teach you in the best way, because it learns how you learn and as your awareness grows and takes hold.
- First item to tackle is homelessness

>"If I could figure out a way to build a collective war chest that could crack a small fraction of the tourism industry - that would be enough to offset the problem."

>"I want to solve the problems that we face as human beings and solve them with decentralization and AI."

We will schedule a follow-up
I'll make sure he can get back to me. This is a really good connection.

The perp walk of Luigi was the kicker - made everybody feel like Luigi was SUPER not the guy. IDK.

### "How do I put systems in place to be able to get my ideas out of my head"

Is having trouble typing prompts that can get the info he needs.
Has the nonprofit license and everything.
Needs the words, needs clarity, has a hard time pulling the words out of his head.

>"I don't like the main players, I don't want to use them, but I have no choice."

- KPI - 1% of the world's population to work together. A 1% conscious focus to the problems one problem at a time would create a fundamental cascading domino effect that will create an accelerating exponential.
- Highly morally driven. Wants to help move the world away from what he sees as unethical and immoral exploitation of the natural world and the people in it.
- "I want to show people that we can change things."
- Wants to build an AI system called ARCANA - Autonomous Reasoning bot
- Highly morally motivated
- The distance between idea and reality is getting MUCH shorter.

Here's the pitch: I think this guy belongs in the Multiverse Prompt engineering class.

Got a lot of time on my hands until I'm gonna be up in Seattle. I have to wait until Dec 26th to get my Chase account back up to 0, and then I'll need to close it out Friday (if the bank is open) and open up a new one so that I don't keep getting fucked on all these subscriptions that I keep forgetting to cancel.

Ok my GOD do I love the feeling of logging into Stripe and seeing that I made money while I was just hanging out with Elo.

Literally the dream come true - to make money while I'm at fucking band practice.

It finally, FINALLY came fucking true. Holy shit dude. WOW.

I'm up to $470 total now look:

![[Screen Shot 2024-12-24 at 7.05.51 PM.png]]

What a fucking journey to get here man. I had to learn SO much.

And how did I not know about voice control for the computer this is genuinely incredible and will probably change my life a lot

I can enter commands like "Open Chrome" and it will just do it I can also leave the cursor open on the obsidian window and I can just talk to my computer and dictate my notes into my notepad this is something I've literally been trying to do since I was in my early 20s in college this is I've been a fantasy of mine since forever to be able to write a book with my voice in a way that is reliable transparent consistent away that captures pretty much everything I need to capture but in a way that doesn't like break my ability to get my own you know thoughts out this is incredibly cool
