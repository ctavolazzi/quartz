## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Wed, 01/01/2025, 11:49`
The first of the year and all is not well.

I have never been more sad and aware of just how much my life is fucked up.

I have never felt more scared, sad, stressed, and violated.

My awareness of everything I lost is palpable and I am having a LOT of trouble holding things together. The holidays are always extremely difficult.

All I had to do to keep my comfort, my life, was to just...not do the things I did. That's literally it. Just...don't.

Now I have to deal with another YEAR of bullshit consequences and garbage with NO money and I'm just...I'm scared and alone and fucked.

Maybe I'll ask all my friends for help and get my life together. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what to do or how to be or how to act or what to do.

I'll ask Ben for help with lawyers. I can't ask my family they won't help me they don't even want to talk to me and they all have no money.

I hate this society. I hate this way of organizing the world. It's cruel and wrong and evil. I hate it so, so so so so much. I currently don't believe I'll ever be able to fix the relationships I broke. But that's ok. Maybe I need to let it all go and just focus on putting one foot in front of the other, one single day of survival at a time.

My fantasy, the thing that's been getting me through, has been that I'll somehow magically pull it together and build enough resources to come back and be a force for good and safety and light. But I don't believe that's going to be possible anymore.

I fucked up. So did everyone else in my life. They failed me and I failed them. We did everything in our power but it wasn't enough. That's not a failure, that's just life.

I need to tell my people the honest truth. And I think I'll do it on the 15th.

For now, I need to get my phone line turned on by going to T-Mobile and getting everything switched over.

Then I can start making phone calls again. And that will make things go well, fast.
