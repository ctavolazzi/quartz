## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Sun, 12/01/2024, 12:38`
December 1st, 2024.
Not the way I thought I'd be spending the holiday season, but you know what? The best part of life is the as long as you're alive you always have the opportunity to try again!
I'm in [[Stoble]] pltting my YouTube rise to stardom hahaha
But actually tho...that's literally what I'm doing.
I've heard that lifestyle content doesn't do as well anymore, and instead it's all about making videos for specific SEO terms. IDK. I think it's still about personality and connection and feeling relatable.
What's more relatable than someone who wants what you want and works to achieve it? Someone who's just a *little* but further along on their journey?
That's who I'm trying to be.
I see the game, and I intend to play it to the best of my ability, while retainin my integrity, and holding on to what I've got.

## Today's Video Examples

### Example 1) [Outdoor Boys](https://www.youtube.com/@OutdoorBoys)

Look at this guy! It's just him, a GoPro, the snow, and his knowledge of the wilderness. He's just out there walking around, telling stories. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

**How to Emulate?**
To emulate this video, focus on these key elements:

1. **Authentic Storytelling**: Share personal anecdotes about your experiences in the wilderness, including challenges and successes.
2. **Visual Appeal**: Use a high-quality camera to capture stunning winter landscapes and wildlife around you.
3. **Informative Content**: Discuss relevant topics like wildlife management practices and the effects of clear cuts in an engaging manner.
4. **Natural Delivery**: Maintain a relaxed demeanor; speak as if you're having a conversation with friends rather than presenting formally.
5. **Engagement with Nature**: Interact with your surroundings—point out interesting features of the landscape or behaviors of animals you encounter.
6. **Editing Style**: Keep edits minimal to preserve the flow of natural ambiance; use background music sparingly to maintain focus on your voice.

By blending informative content with genuine passion for nature, you'll create relatable videos that resonate with your audience.

Fame changes people lol. This dad, I believe, would not be acting this way if the camera wasn't on. The kid has 3.32 million subscribers. 

And of course he does. look at his page, look at his content:

I remember kids like this growing up who had a following and ended up crashing out.

Maybe that's what's tripping me up? Maybe I'm afraid of crashing out. Idk. Maybe.

Ok, video essays in this style would actually be really fun. I can't lie, this was a lot of fun to watch. I would watch my own videos if they were like this. I like it. Picasso.

To emulate the video style, focus on these key elements:

1. **Authentic Storytelling**: Share personal anecdotes about your experiences in the wilderness, including challenges and successes.
2. **Visual Appeal**: Use a high-quality camera to capture stunning winter landscapes and wildlife around you.
3. **Informative Content**: Discuss relevant topics like wildlife management practices and the effects of clear cuts in an engaging manner.
4. **Natural Delivery**: Maintain a relaxed demeanor; speak as if you're having a conversation with friends rather than presenting formally.
5. **Engagement with Nature**: Interact with your surroundings—point out interesting features of the landscape or behaviors of animals you encounter.
6. **Editing Style**: Keep edits minimal to preserve the flow of natural ambiance; use background music sparingly to maintain focus on your voice.

By blending informative content with genuine passion for nature, you'll create relatable videos that resonate with your audience.

I think I want to keep this chronological format, with the day starting and then me just adding things lower in the feed, instead of higher. The pokemon will indicate to me where I should be adding stuff.

I'm working on figuring out my process. I'm in the vibe. If I had a video right now of myself talking I would be editing right now. I have BIG EDITING ENERGY at this moment. Not really interested in recording, but in editing. Yet I have nothing to edit, so I must find my way upstairs into the workspace so that I can record what I need to say today.

He is often associated with the ability to charm all living things and even inanimate objects with his music. Orpheus is best known for his journey to the Underworld to retrieve his wife, Eurydice, after her death. His story symbolizes themes of love, loss, and the power of art.

## 🐾 Today's Pokémon

Huntail (#367)

![Huntail Sprite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/367.png)

- **Type(s):** water
- **Abilities:** swift-swim, water-veil
- **Stats:** hp: 55, attack: 104, defense: 105, special-attack: 94, special-defense: 75, speed: 52

> "Gotta catch 'em all!" — *Pokémon Trainer*

In the shimmering waters of a secluded ocean cove, Huntail, the elusive Pokémon known for its sleek body and captivating allure, swam gracefully. As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Huntail's luminescent tail flickered like a beacon in the deep blue sea.

One day, as he glided through his underwater domain, Huntail stumbled upon an old shipwreck covered in coral. Curious about this mysterious structure from above the waves, he cautiously approached. To his surprise, nestled among the wreckage was a shimmering pearl that radiated a soft glow.

Determined to uncover its secret, Huntail nudged it gently with his snout. Instantly, a whirlpool of energy enveloped him. The pearl unleashed a wave of memories from sailors long lost at sea—tales of adventure, love, and yearning for home.

Huntail found himself mesmerized by these echoes of life once lived above. Inspired by their stories and infused with newfound courage from within the depths of his heart, he realized he could be more than just an observer; he could become a storyteller himself.

From that day on, every time Huntail returned to his favorite spot near the shipwreck during sunset, he shared tales captured from whispers in the water with other Pokémon who gathered around him—a wise sage beneath the waves who taught them about bravery and hope amidst life's currents. And thus began Huntail's legacy as not just a swift swimmer but also as an unforgettable storyteller of the ocean's mysteries.

Based on your reflections and the journey you've been undertaking, a key insight for today revolves around **embracing vulnerability as a catalyst for creativity**. Your candid exploration of self-doubt and the fear of judgment highlights a common barrier many creators face. However, you’ve also identified a powerful shift in your mindset: the recognition that sharing your experiences and insights can not only validate your own feelings but also resonate deeply with others who may feel similarly.

This vulnerability can serve as a source of strength. By allowing yourself to be open about your fears and aspirations, you invite authenticity into your work, which can foster a genuine connection with your audience. This approach aligns with the idea that true creativity flourishes when we are not afraid to show our true selves, imperfections and all.

Consider leveraging this insight by channeling your daily experiences into your content creation. Your unique perspective, especially as "thecoffeejesus," can bridge the gap between technology and personal narrative, making your work not only informative but also relatable. This dual focus on authentic storytelling and technical insight can set you apart in the digital space.
