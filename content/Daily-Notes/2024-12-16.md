## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 08:03`
Monday vibes! We're here and it's amazing
Attendance today:
- Phil, Katie, Tara, Barb

Katie has a drone update: It's allegedly a human-made drone that's looking for gamma ray updates, because allegedly something is making plasmoids unintentionally.

Tara suggests it could be a distraction. Project Blue Beam. That kind of stuff.

Barb feels like the only available adult with the ability to make responsible choices in her family sometimes (as we all do from time to time) so she asked for help using AI to help care for your aging family members.

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 08:15`
You're gonna have to show that you're taking care of yourself and that will help others. Nobody wants to be told what to do, they want to be shown options and then choose the one that feels best.

We of course understand the resistance to trying new things that you don't trust, but there's more there.

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 08:27`
I asserted that we are about to hit a massive abundance curve, a massive new availability of choice that we have never experienced on planet earth before. Never in human history have we experienced such rapid progress.

Katie says a lot of this is dependent on the current uprising in class consciousness.

Tara says we've been pushing kids to get into engineering and they're taking on massive debt, but now we're hitting the point where they're not needed and AI can do it. There's talk about jobs being taken over and displaced. She's curious how long the disruption will last before the correction happens.

There will be a transition between the death throws of late stage capitalism and UBI or a transition away from money completely.

That's a really solid point IMO.

Barb says she had the opportunity to work with someone who was previously at [[OpenAI]]. Of course this is a very very very privileged person. She says there will be a transition where the most privileged among society will have such a different reality based on how they are being affected by AI in society. That's where community support comes into play. All the pieces of history coming together equal a way to support and balance the trauma created by the exchange.
The privileged are able to create something greater, but the labor class, the people without access to capital, the people who are technologically challenged, cannot see past that veil.
She thinks lots of people will die just from the emotional toll of the revolution alone. 
Some people sustain that there needs to be a universal income, but who controls that, and how, and why. She just wants her whiskey and margaritas and horses on the beach.

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 08:49`
Ben says the more we've talked about this over the last few months, the more we see how there's a lot of doomsayers, a lot of politics crashing, a lot of comparisons to Germany and France in history right before the historically tumultuous and dangerous times. And we have in this group the knowledge about what's coming and what AI is capable of. It's gonna be scary cuz people don't know what to do with it and when it arrives, it's gonna blindside people. But once people start to understand it and incorporate it into their lives, it's gonna be adopted by the masses just like electricity was.

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 09:27`
Ravi says the Black Swan event is coming soon. Really soon.
Siren says "Don't you think everyone will need an AI gardener?" Yes. Absolutely.
Siren says the current mode of technology is oppressive. How do I convince my mom, my people, to think more critically about the tools she uses on a daily basis? How can we bring the tools closer to people so they are able to use things that are beyond their comprehension.

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 09:55`
It's like comparing Horse & Buggy to Cars to Rockets. They're all transportation, but that's where the similarities end. And people project all their experiences in a Horse & Buggy onto the car. They say "those cars go too fast and they don't fit on the Buggy roads, they're not good for anything." But then they see the rockets and they go "I don't like rockets, they're dangerous and they're scaring my horses." But the rocket can get you to the fucking moon. A horse is never going to get you to space. And the rocket people can't understand what the horse people want, and likewise the horse people can't understand why the rocket people would even want to build rockets in the first place.
And as always, the rocket parts fall on people's towns and they really are disrupting things and the rockets are implemented in a way that oftentimes hurts people.

# These are such valid points that EVERYONE is echoing right now

>The general consensus is "How the fuck are we supposed to get our needs met?"

And I FEEL that.

Ok today I'm gonna work on getting the [[Johnny Autoseed]] website POPPIN

https://johnnyautoseed.com needs to be the best motherfucking site around.
OORAH

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 13:38`
Yay! We got the Johnny Autoseed site working! Yahoo!

Look at it:
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-16 at 1.39.24 PM.png]]

Beautiful. There's a waitlist and everything :)

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 13:39`
We also got [[Datavault]] working??? Whaaaaattt??
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-16 at 1.40.17 PM.png]]

`Mon, 12/16/2024, 18:21`
Ok Datavault is NOT working, but I AM learning about how to retrieve data from GitHub, and how to run processing and permutations on that data.
I think I might be at the end of my explorations and now needing to fully focus on Johnny Autoseed.

I got my first waitlist subscriber today.

One day. It took one day to get an email through my website.

Not even overnight. Just...happened.

This is it man.

Showtime.
