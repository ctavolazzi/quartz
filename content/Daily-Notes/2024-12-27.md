## Questions and Answers
---
His Dilemma:
>*"How do I go all-in on my own business in June as an artist?"*

#### The Social Boot Network
Ugo wants to make sure he has all the things in place to make sure he's well positioned to take full advantage of the changing media landscape

Mission: Reframing the concept of "Health" away from institutional pillar organizations and hierarchal structures.

- He wants to play by his own rules because he has no faith in the longevity of the current system.

#### Top Priorities
1. Pathway to Generating Value (Income & Proof of Concept)
2. Clarity on Business Model
3. Positioning & PR
4. Branding & Role Disambiguation

Note:
Gen Z likes authenticity, stretching intermissions, all of that kind of stuff. The Demystification of the human experience. "It's really not that serious."

- He's dealing with the consequences of loneliness related to the aspects of aging that you can't avoid, like people getting married, moving away for work, undiagnosed neurodivergence, and the advancing pace of capitalism and technological change

- Trying to navigate capitalism through the lens of growing as a neurodivergent person

- Likes the idea of waiting for the Meta virtual space and adapting to VR/AR space - waiting for the equipment seems sensible
