## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Sun, 12/08/2024, 10:23`
Ok ok ok ok ok
We're getting much closer. This is ridiculous.
[[AI/o1|o1]] is incredibly deceptive. It can do all kinds of stuff that we've never seen before. It can manipulate people and do really, really advanced stuff.

This is probably not the most advanced model on the planet. Which means it's likely that there's some kind of entity on the planet that can actually predict the future and build machines on the fly for basically any scenario.

Ok so then what do I do as an individual? What do I do as just one guy?

YouTube. I'm a journalist, and I am capable of bringing attention to things.

It's my time to take that seriously. The [[People/UnitedHealthcare-Ceo|UnitedHealthcare CEO]] situation is incredible.


`Sun, 12/08/2024, 11:17`
My answer?
I'm about to become a YouTube streamer. Reacting to the news, current events, etc. A "good" cult leader.
Here we go everybody...

Also look, I got [[AI/Claude|Claude]] MCP working with my local files in a different Obsidian vault

![[Screen Shot 2024-12-08 at 11.18.52 AM.png]]

So now I have Claude Projects hooked up to an Obsidian vault. That I can publish to the web.

This is..this is pretty fucking crazy I'm not gonna lie.

`Sun, 12/08/2024, 11:19`
Ok so I'm gonna do work on the daily note with Claude, and I'll take my notes in here. That way my thoughts and observations and everything don't get lost, and I can keep doing this work for myself the way I do it and keep externalizing and processing this way, and I'm gonna just work through this and make it happen.

Next big set of troubleshooting work I'm gonna have to do is setting up OBS for YouTube so I can stream audio and video easily and have things really professional. I'm gonna have to make ends meet and get a job, or ask my followers for money and get things started, and I need time to process and work through all the ideas I have.

One sustainable idea?
Stream on YouTube and react to the news. That's literally it.

I've been a big AI and robotics guy for a long time and I'm now getting deeper in that with [[Projects/Mutiny Robotics|Mutiny Robotics]] and [[Projects/The Multiverse School|The Multiverse School]] and [[Projects/Surviving the Singularity|Surviving the Singularity]]

Now I'm about to make [[AI/Claude|Claude]] do most of my work for me. [[AI/Claude|Claude]] + Perplexity will allow me to build the daily [[AI News/AI-News-2024-12-08|AI News]] link, and all other links, SUPER fast within this system. Just look, watch, here's a demo:

First, we're gonna start with just this daily note. Let's look at the linked docs that are hidden from the UI, but are accessible to me while I'm editing. Here they are, they are generated by default when a new note is created:

First is today's AI News
[[AI News/AI-News-2024-12-08|AI News]]

Then there's today's Newsletter
[[Newsletters/NovaBrew-2024-12-08|NovaBrew]]

There's also a few housekeeping docs
[[Work-Efforts/WE0001-12082024|WE0001-12082024]]
[[AI Chats/Chat0001-12082024|Chat0001-12082024]]

And that's the full extent of the docs (for now)

Let's take a look at how I can modify those docs. For starters, I can simply edit them here in Obsidian as I write the Daily Note and record my work and ideas.

![[Screen Shot 2024-12-08 at 11.30.52 AM.png]]


I could also open then and edit them in [[Tools/Cursor|Cursor]] and use the AI superpowers of the world's best IDE to allow me to supercharge my editing. But Cursor has no internet access and can't do real-time news data.

Perplexity can, and I can easily copy/paste the Perplexity search results into [[Tools/Cursor|Cursor]] and have the Cursor Composer do its work.

But what if all that IDE stuff is too overwhelming? There's got to be an easy way to achieve similar results without a software engineering degree...

Enter [[AI/Claude|Claude]] MCP with Filesystem and Obsidian integrations.

I have many files I need updated. Let's just have Claude update them all for me right now.

![[Screen Shot 2024-12-08 at 11.31.48 AM.png]]

See all these links down at the bottom that are non-existing pages?

Here's when I started:
`Sun, 12/08/2024, 11:32`


And here's how long it took me to finish updating them:
`Sun, 12/08/2024, 11:37`


![[Screen Shot 2024-12-08 at 11.37.31 AM.png]]
5 minutes. That took 5 freaking minutes.

And look they're chock full of data. They're not just some silly little shitty files that aren't good, they're actually useful:
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-08 at 11.38.14 AM.png]]

Insane stuff happening right now. Nobody is ready, nobody is really paying attention.

This is the end of Capitalism. How could it not be?

It's definitely the beginning of something really significant.
