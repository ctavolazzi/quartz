## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Thu, 11/28/2024, 11:28`
Strange...
The more I sink into this, the better it feels.
I still intuitively feel like I'm in danger...but I also feel like anything that happens to me from now on is cannon fodder to be turned into content.
I've studied. I've done my time. I've put in my 10,000 hours and more.
Let's. Do. This.

This transition into a YouTube career feels significant; it’s an opportunity to share my voice, embrace change, and connect with others. I’m determined to turn every experience, whether good or bad, into content that resonates with my audience. Let’s do this!!!!

Thanksgiving day :) :(
It's a mixed bag. I have never felt like holidays were exciting. They were always chaotic and stressful when I was a kid, and now as an adult I'm ready to start defining my own norms for the holidays.
It's time man. I keep saying that but I'm also settling in to what will become the next few years of my life.
It's not every day you just sort of settle in to that.
I'm with friends and I'm happy this is a good day already, but I'm ready for it to get better and better year over year. I know that's a big thing to say with all the terrible stuff looming on the horizon, but also, that narrative sucks and I don't want to participate in a culture of fear anymore.
Life is what you make it and we all have A) a limited time before we die and B) the chance at that not being the case with [[LEV]] looming as well.
This is one of the most important eras in human history. I'm ready for it.
I am going to be a YouTuber. That's crazy to think about. I've watched this stuff since I was a kid and now I'm about to join in and participate.
I'm ready for all the backlash, the criticism, the pain, but also the exciting potential and possibilities.
I feel like I owe it to the people I love to become this man. This version of myself that's been budding for years...I'm ready to share it with the world.
My inspiration for style right now is [[oompaville]] this creator seems like someone I could easily emulate.
[oompaville's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@oompaville) has 5.6 million subscribers and he mostly makes commentary and collabs in the classic YouTube editing style.

My plan is to set up the camera wherever, print out and read a list of topics to cover that day like the Journalist I am, and then edit the video together later using this editing stack:
- [[Descript]]
- [[CapCut]]
- [[AfterEffects]]
- [[Blender]]
- [[Unreal Engine]]
- [[Davinci Resolve]] (if necessary)
- Various AI Tools

### Editing Process:
1. Capture video of me talking about current events with the context of history and futurism
2. Edit the raw content in Descript to make the video script make logical sense
3. Port to CapCut and start editing
4. Add effects with Blender and After Effects
5. Add scenes with Unreal
6. Edit the final video in Davinci or CapCut
7. Add the captions
8. Add the metadata
9. Publish
