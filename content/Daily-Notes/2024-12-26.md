Got to add some buttons to the Johnny Autoseed site

Ok today I worked on tuning up the Johnny Autoseed landing page with common questions and concerns and complaints.

Here's the full thing:

It's SUCH a fucking good site. SUCH a GREAT funnel holy shit.

Eddie and the other scammers over at Super Entrepreneur or whatever the fuck are charging over $10k for this
And I see why. It's genuinely fucking worth it.

I've already made $500. in the first week. That would take me 20 weeks to make 10k. Relatively passively now...just by meeting with people on my OWN fucking time.

This is... this is great.

I have all my booking calendars set to disallow bookings 12 hours in advance so that means people can't book for the same day but CAN book for the next day. So when I wake up, whatever my day looks like at that moment, that is ALL it's gonna look like.

Dayum
It's the day before the day I move.
I'm going to Seattle the day after tomorrow. The town I've MOST wanted to live in, and I'm going there FOR FREE

I couldn't be happier today :)
