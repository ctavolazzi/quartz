## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Mon, 12/30/2024, 09:37`
It happened.

I'm in Seattle.

I live here now, with Eric, in his busted ass house.

I get it. He has Aspbergers. So do I (probably). We talked till 2am about AI and the future of society.

It was beautiful. I'm so fucking happy.

`Mon, 12/30/2024, 09:50`
Wow

We have, and this is not a joke, over $100k worth of value here. Easily.

We have about 100 videos per cubic meter of physical space here. That's a return of about $100 / video on average so that means we have over $1m worth of value here on this property, easily.

Now my challenge is holding the reins of Eric's mind and directing him.

He said, "I just want to be fed and housed and work in a lab. I just want to be the mad scientist I am without having to think about money."

Same man. Same.

So here we are. Together. Making it happen.

My core is at peace. My heart is full. My life is complete. I can do this. We can make this work literally immediately.

### Step 1) Transformation:
Eric's house is a mess. It's honestly not that bad, it looks like Anthony's house or really anyone's house that has ever had a mental health crisis.

Mental health crisis are ***REMARKABLY NORMAL*** for people like me and Eric. 

Humans ned community to function properly. We NEED a sense of shared identity to orient ourselves around. We are inherently, biologically, deeply social creatures. And if we con't have the social part of our lives in order, then everything falls apart.

This is why I believe people with neurodivergencies do what we do - we used to be the soothsayers and seers and druidic shamans of the past, and now we're cast out of society because we can't sit still and shut up and do what we're told.

Because we're ***RIGHT*** and ***NOBODY IS LISTENING TO US*** until it's too late.

>Them: *"How come you didn't tell me?"*
>Me: "I did. Dozens of times. You weren't listening because it didn't affect you right then. I was trying to prepare you but you didn't want to listen."

Story of my fucking life.

Capitalism really works by funding endless wars, enslaving millions, destroying the natural world and homogenizing global culture to the point where every place looks identical.

But we learn that Socialism is bad because of a famine and corruption.

Right.

`Mon, 12/30/2024, 10:29`
Eric doesn't care at all about money. To the point where he's suffering and his life situation is kind of overwhelming. And believe me, I deeply understand.

Now, I'm here. I'm ready. I'm helping.

Today we're doing a DEEP clean of his house. I'm going to film a timelapse of several rooms being transformed, and then I'll compile them into a YouTube video later.

We will show the world that all of this is A) possible B) accessible C) happening NOW

We ARE THE PEOPLE who will make this life bearable for others like us.

`Mon, 12/30/2024, 10:47`
Ok so I have a call scheduled at 11 for a social media audit. Sick. Then I'll be walking back to Eric's house and doing the cleanup. Today is cleanup day.

`Mon, 12/30/2024, 10:50`
Cleanup, cleanup, everybody everywhere. Clean up, clean up, everybody do your share.

Billy Zurisk Meeting
- Uses ChatGPT all the time
- He's a bartender, trying to escape doing this, wants to do AI stuff
- Wants to make a transition and not do bartending anymore.
- I told him about Obsidian, using ChatGPT in various roles, asking it to make a dossier on you and ask it "What am I overlooking? What opportunities do I have here that I might not be seeing?"
- Told him about the bonsai tree idea and how that is something we're building to sell up here in Seattle, as just ONE of the infinite options.
- Told him how I did it
- He asked about which websites he can use to figure out which AI tools he should be using and I showed him [futuretools.io](https://www.futuretools.io/?tags-vq3k=matts-picks)
- My bread and butter: neurodivergents who have been told their whole life they're doing things wrong, but they're not, and they actually have the ability and deep, intense desire to make this solarpunk shit happen

Now I'm trying to reach Elo while I'm here at this coffee shop so I can get him the info to do the storage unit thing
