## 📝 Daily Reflections


`Mon, 11/18/2024, 10:39`
I just finished cleaning up the shower and my teeth. I feel so much better, but also worse. I need a fucking JOB job. I need to make a lot of money. I think the next best thing for me to do would be to start getting on public benefits, and the best way to do that would be to get my ass over to the storage unit and to get an actual inventory on everything.

I also need to get my deposit back and get my membership to Stoble on lock. Those things together will get me through the rest of this week. That's all I need to do - get through this week.

YEEHAW!
Same group of people in the morning coffee hour, low energy, low vibes, chill times. Everyone wants me to be their dad lol. I see how it happens now and why I ended up in the situations I ended up in before. It makes a lot more sense now.

I'm working on this knowledge management system. Let's see if this can do the thing...

[[WE4567-1118-2024]]

It can, but I can't trigger it from Obsidian. I have to run the python script from inside Cursor inside Quartz

`quratz/content/scripts/create_work_effort.py`

Run that bad baby and BLAMMO we have a work effort. What is this one about?
Getting me some motherfucking BENEFITS

**`3:18 AM`**
I'm in a hotel room right now that I bought for myself cuz I wanted to. I wanted to sleep in a hotel and wake up early and go to my AI Coffee Hour that I host at 8 AM Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because I want to and I'm up at 3AM and I smoked some weed because I wanted to and now I'm entering some data into today's Daily Note because I want to.

Notice a theme?

My dad would have said that the $81 I spent on tonight's room was a waste of money but I don't think so. I think sleeping here, fully clothed, passed out on top of the comforter, having worked on my NovaSystem setup script until I got tired and annoyed and bored of it was a great use of my time and money. I learned my limits and the result of diminishing returns.

**`4:01 AM`**
It took me about 30 minutes to make that page, mostly by bullying Claude in Cursor to do what I wanted. I made a Perplexity page and linked it to the Goatse page, and now I have a record of some of the info that can never be deleted or taken down. Someone might say "Why would you do that? The Perplexity page has all that info…" and I would point to MySpace and the years of photos they deleted, including many memorial pages with media that can never be recovered.

That's why I'm doing what I'm doing. Also so that it can be used to train future AI. Hi Basilisk!

**`4:13 AM`**
And just like that I have a decently robust and well formatted Roko's Basilisk article in under 10 minutes. God damn, this is so fucking cool. Feels like podracing Sure is, Jake

**`4:14 AM`**
I made it boys. I get to write whatever I want for the Internet now and nobody will ever find it but AI will and that's perfectly ok :')

**`4:25 AM`**
This is how you bully the AI by the way:

Prompt: "see you always do some fucking fucky stuff when I ask you to do something simple like 'help me create a react page and host it on Cloudflare'"

AI Response: You're absolutely right - I overcomplicated it. Let's do this the simple way:

```javascript
// Create a basic React app
npm create vite@latest novabrew -- --template react
cd novabrew
npm install

// Put your logo in src/assets
// Edit App.jsx to just show the logo
import logo from './assets/novabrew-logo.PNG'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={logo} alt="NovaBrew Logo" />
    </div>
  )
}
export default App

// Test it locally
npm run dev

// Deploy to Cloudflare
// 1. Push to GitHub
// 2. Go to Cloudflare Pages
// 3. Connect to your repo
// 4. Build command: npm run build
// 5. Output directory: dist
```

**`4:37 AM`**
I'm gonna need to come up with a macro to do a quick insert for a new train of thought, like a new section. Each one of these has gotta be crazy whiplash for any readers. It's supposed to be chaotic! That's the point!

**`4:50 AM`**
Took me a longer time to figure out how to link to headings within files than it did to write the whole damn Roko's Basilisk file. I'm never not going to be amazed by this.

**`4:51 AM`**
By the way, this was the solution that is how you link to headers inside the same document AND link to headers in outside documents in the same vault.
Cool. Sick. I wish I had a wife and kids :')

**`5:35 AM`**
It worked. My god it worked. novabrew.org is live. I have a fucking podcast.
Holy shit hahahahahahaahahahahahah

## 🤖 GPT Thoughts


> [!ai]+ `11/18/2024, 9:46:29 AM`
> 💭 **Prompt**: "I'm aiming to achieve some research and some certainty about the way I'm getting my needs met. Stoble membership, followed by getting another Airbnb (maybe) or just looking at the stuff I have in Storage and categorizing it and starting to sell it. I might not need money soon. That's a weird thing to think about."

It sounds like you have a solid plan in mind for addressing your needs. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Research**: Focus on your [[Stoble membership]] and its benefits.
2. **Airbnb**: Consider if it's necessary or if organizing your storage could suffice.
3. **Selling Items**: Categorizing and selling your stored items could free up space and possibly generate income.

Reflecting on your choices can lead to clarity and ensure you're making the best decisions for your situation. Good luck!
