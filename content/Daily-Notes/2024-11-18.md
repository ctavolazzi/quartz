## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 20:14`
I found [[British Bulldog Ales]] here in Chico. I love this place. Open to 8 or 9 or whenever every night? They know me and introduced me as "the best tour guide ever"? I love it here.

I'm about to code up a React browser game thingy at [[novabrew.org]] just for fun just cuz so I can cuz fuck it shy not.

Let's mine for some intelligence for fun.

I'm at [[Banshee]] yet again. I love it here man, the vibe is just immaculate.
I learned something - the words I'm smithing in [[The Multiverse School]] class are more scalable than I realized. If I just go on #YouTube and say the same shit I said tonight in class, I bet that people would find it valuable.
Sure, a few thousand folks, or even millions, might think I'm silly or dumb or whatever other negative opinion they might have about me.
But the same number of people might hear what I said, something that seems simple and obvious to me, they might hear it and suddenly realize something they needed to understand, something that changes their life for the better. If I **DON'T** do that I'm robbing that person of the chance to have that information delivered, that experience happen, and that transformation happen.
If I don't express myself openly and honestly with YouTube, then i'm denying someone out there the chance to have the kind of positive, life-altering, empowering experience Katie has had with me, or Tara, or TK, or Ryan or Liz. If I let my demons win, my insecurities stop me, I deny those people the chance to fully understand themselves in the same way that I would have been denied if the people I learned from had never spoken out. 

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 19:20`
I haven't been served yet lol. They don't like me anymore :( 
No that's not true. I'm just being lowkey incognito they're not looking my way I'm in the corner where they're not working it's my fault. Although it is SUPER weird to go from walking downtown and having everyone say hi to me, introduce me to their friends and family, invite me places, etc... to just... nothing....
That still feels weird to me. I haven't gotten used to it. It used to feel so friendly and alive. Now? It's just old stories and a handful of people who remember anything about what those things were like and how it felt to be part of it all. They're just as sad as I am that it's not happening anymore. It was tight. Now it's just... it's just different. It's not the same and everyone feels it. Well...everyone who's left. Most of the people who made this downtown feel like it felt have either moved away or they've started working different places. Some of them started families. SOme blocked me. Others moved away and started new lives. Many simply dropped off the radar and started working some office job and stopped going out, stopped partying, and started spending more time volunteering for the local softball team.
Others simply grew up, started taking care of their mom, started giving lessons to aspiring swimmers, or otherwise realized that they're in their 30s and they need to slow down.
That's me. That's where I'm at. I'm not the party, I never was. I was just a guy who wanted to eat snacks with his friends. I have that...sort of. Sometimes. I try. But it' snot the same. It could be...but I'm not the same. I don't have the same passion I once had. I just want to sit around and make videos and make money from that and educate the world and let that take me on a cruise for work and make my lifestyle just...doing things and helping people.

Installing [[RAG]] systems would do it. Traveling to install secure, offline, HIPPA compliant RAG systems for people around the world would do it. Or traveling to invest in and install some kind of energy generation for developing areas. That would do it too.

By "do it" I mean allow me to make my lifestyle traveling to help people with a specific problem that I am particularly well suited to solve.

I'm ready.

Let's do this. YouTube is the most scalable highest ROI thing I can do with myself and my time.

Learning to code was important, and I feel like understanding this stuff from the level I do was a necessary prerequisite for the next layer of AI tech development and societal transformation we're about to live through.

I'm going to pursue some specific sponsorship and other opportunities tomorrow, including social services. I'll look into grants etc while I wait and use this system I'm developing to do this workflow energy management.

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 19:32`
Ok I know what I gotta do...now I just gotta fucking do it. I know how, when where, why, how much work it's gonna take, who I'll meet, what to watch out for, how it's gonna go down, and precisely what I can expect to receive if it goes well, and if it doesn't.
I'm there. Let's do this.
It begins tomorrow. The day before my 35th birthday. Not how I imagined my birthday would go. Yet here we are. I'm here, so is everyone else. Such is life. So be it.

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 19:35`
Tomorrow I gotta do the coffee hour at 8, so I'll need to plug my phone into the big battery to make sure it charges. Then I'll need to get to Stoble with plenty of time to get the coffee and everything brewed and ready and everything, so I'll probably need to get there early as fuck like 7 am or so. Well, after that I'll have the whole day to simply work on the things I gotta do, like getting on social services, or maybe even selling the stuff I have in storage.
Then I'll do some YouTube recording in the quiet booth in the Stoble Workspace, and at 5 I'll give another Intro to AI class for the handful of people who will show up just to chill and talk and vibe. 
Then it's my birthday, which I don't expect much from, and I'll work and do another AI class, and it'll be nice and they'll wish me a happy birthday, and I'll spend the night in the same place I did before with the hella nice tub. 
Then the real work begins.
I gotta get my ass to Detroit. That's where the real money is for me. 
YouTube and Detroit.
That's my next mission. That's my next life - YouTuber on a mission to make Robot Gardeners a thing with [[Johnny Autoseed]]

Let's do this thing. The world needs it. The people need robot gardeners built by someone like me more than they need fun music. That's sad, but today, for me, it's true. The music can come soon. I can be one of the other people who makes stuff that feels fun after I solve this problem. I'll rest as I work on solving this problem for myself and for others. It's only a matter of time till [[AGI]] shows up and helps us build [[ASI]] - that will help me build robot gardeners. The more runway I build, the more of the bridge I make, the better the experience of sticking the landing and nailing the stunt will be
This is the moment when we get ready to pull off the crazy move. We all look at each other, knowing the math checks out, the risks are real, but they're mitigated and the chances of success are pretty high. Higher than failure. Higher than they should be.
You look at your friends and you all have the same thought: 
> "***Are we really doing this?***"

Yes. Yes you really are.

## Intro to AI Class

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 17:02`
>Tara - I'm trying to learn the difference between LLMs, AI, and Agents
>What do I need from an API
> How to use APIs
> Tara was listening to Liz class talking about swarms and agents
> Has questions about how to monitor your own diabetes and glucose tradking
> You would create your own data and you would have the agent be able to look at your data and be able to find correlation and then classify the data
> Question: "How many agents would I need?"

SarahL responded that the "Benchmarks"[[AI Agents]] class would be beneficial

- Do I want multiple agents talking and finding a solution or do I want one central agent handling everything?

This is a VERY autistic group hahahaha

SarahL says that it's about prioritizing the ways you're allocating and budgeting your energy. The autism attracts the vibe doesn't it??

Wild. I forget about it all the time.

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 17:11`
SarahL says what is working now is using ChatGPT to use it to fix your workflow.

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 18:10`
ChatGPT is a magic guessing machine that can give you a confidence interval. It's a magic statistical prediction engine.

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 18:50`
Notes for new curriculum
1. Cognitive processing - learning more about yourself is always valuable (you are a prediction engine always trying to find out if. you're right and so is everybody else and that explains their behavior)
2. ChatGPT prompting tips - people use this every day and need help
3. Notekeeping systems like Obsidian - Capturing the work you do with ChatGPT and construcing better prompts using Obsidian is a super valuable thing
4. Making people feel less alone - telling my story and showing my processes seems to be a hit every time
5. Validation - you're doing good - a pat on the head is always valuable - reassurance is what I sold at Naked Lounge
6. Beginner intimidation hump jumping - helping people deconstruct stuff and get out of their head - help me stop thinking "I have to shut up around the people who know stuff" - community and camaraderie and companionship and socializing and feeling less alone and less isolated and lose - relief, genuine and simple
7. People feel embarrassed to even ask ChatGPT - you're fine just show people an example and let them think you're an idiot cuz for the other people it will be super beneficial. Give them time to process and generate a new understanding. Your videos will be the touch point that allows people to begin to formulate their understanding of the new paradigm, and will help people see that they can do it for themselves.

I think this bad boy is finally ready for the real fuckin rodeo. Let's get this show on the road -- time to make some YouTube video goodness from [[Stoble]] just like I always planned to. Let's DO THIS THING :)

---

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 10:39`
I just finished cleaning up the shower and my teeth. I feel so much better, but also worse. I need a fucking JOB job. I need to make a lot of money. I think the next best thing for me to do would be to start getting on public benefits, and the best way to do that would be to get my ass over to the storage unit and to get an actual inventory on everything.

[[Astribot-S1]] - This new humanoid robot from China is incredibly fast and precise. Need to keep an eye on this for future automation possibilities.

`Mon, 11/18/2024, 09:46`
YEEHAW!
Same group of people in the morning coffee hour, low energy, low vibes, chill times. Everyone wants me to be their dad lol. I see how it happens now and why I ended up in the situations I ended up in before. It makes a lot more sense now.

I'm working on this knowledge management system. Let's see if this can do the thing...

[[WE4567-1118-2024]]

It can, but I can't trigger it from Obsidian. I have to run the python script from inside Cursor inside Quartz

`quratz/content/scripts/create_work_effort.py`

Run that bad baby and BLAMMO we have a work effort. What is this one about?
Getting me some motherfucking BENEFITS

**`3:18 AM`**
I'm in a hotel room right now that I bought for myself cuz I wanted to. I wanted to sleep in a hotel and wake up early and go to my AI Coffee Hour that I host at 8 AM Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because I want to and I'm up at 3AM and I smoked some weed because I wanted to and now I'm entering some data into today's Daily Note because I want to.

Notice a theme?

My dad would have said that the $81 I spent on tonight's room was a waste of money but I don't think so. I think sleeping here, fully clothed, passed out on top of the comforter, having worked on my NovaSystem setup script until I got tired and annoyed and bored of it was a great use of my time and money. I learned my limits and the result of diminishing returns.

**`4:01 AM`**
It took me about 30 minutes to make that page, mostly by bullying Claude in Cursor to do what I wanted. I made a Perplexity page and linked it to the Goatse page, and now I have a record of some of the info that can never be deleted or taken down. Someone might say "Why would you do that? The Perplexity page has all that info…" and I would point to MySpace and the years of photos they deleted, including many memorial pages with media that can never be recovered.

That's why I'm doing what I'm doing. Also so that it can be used to train future AI. Hi Basilisk!

**`4:13 AM`**
And just like that I have a decently robust and well formatted Roko's Basilisk article in under 10 minutes. God damn, this is so fucking cool. Feels like podracing Sure is, Jake

**`4:14 AM`**
I made it boys. I get to write whatever I want for the Internet now and nobody will ever find it but AI will and that's perfectly ok :')

**`4:25 AM`**
This is how you bully the AI by the way:

Prompt: "see you always do some fucking fucky stuff when I ask you to do something simple like 'help me create a react page and host it on Cloudflare'"

AI Response: You're absolutely right - I overcomplicated it. Let's do this the simple way:

```javascript
// Create a basic React app
npm create vite@latest novabrew -- --template react
cd novabrew
npm install

// Put your logo in src/assets
// Edit App.jsx to just show the logo
import logo from './assets/novabrew-logo.PNG'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={logo} alt="NovaBrew Logo" />
    </div>
  )
}
export default App

// Test it locally
npm run dev

// Deploy to Cloudflare
// 1. Push to GitHub
// 2. Go to Cloudflare Pages
// 3. Connect to your repo
// 4. Build command: npm run build
// 5. Output directory: dist
```

**`4:37 AM`**
I'm gonna need to come up with a macro to do a quick insert for a new train of thought, like a new section. Each one of these has gotta be crazy whiplash for any readers. It's supposed to be chaotic! That's the point!

**`4:50 AM`**
Took me a longer time to figure out how to link to headings within files than it did to write the whole damn Roko's Basilisk file. I'm never not going to be amazed by this.

**`4:51 AM`**
By the way, this was the solution that is how you link to headers inside the same document AND link to headers in outside documents in the same vault.
Cool. Sick. I wish I had a wife and kids :')

**`5:35 AM`**
It worked. My god it worked. novabrew.org is live. I have a fucking podcast.
Holy shit hahahahahahaahahahahahah

## 🤖 GPT Thoughts


> [!ai]+ `11/18/2024, 7:17:13 PM`
> 💭 **Prompt**: "Focus on the idea that I talk about in the YoUTube section where I said that I would have been denied if "the people i learned from had never spoken out" think about that please"

The idea you mentioned emphasizes the importance of sharing knowledge and experiences. By expressing your insights on [[YouTube]], you create opportunities for others to learn and grow, just as you did from those who shared before you. **Not speaking out could deny someone the chance for transformation**, highlighting the ripple effect of open communication in personal development. Your voice matters in fostering understanding and connection.
The importance of sharing knowledge is profound. By expressing your insights on YouTube, you not only honor those who helped you but also create a pathway for others to learn and transform. Every story shared can resonate with someone in need of guidance or clarity. Your willingness to speak out fosters a community of understanding and connection, empowering others to explore their potential just as you did. The ripple effect of open communication is vital in personal development; it allows for growth and transformation that might otherwise remain untapped.
If you didn't share your insights and experiences, you might unknowingly hinder someone's growth or understanding. The potential transformations that could occur from your voice being heard would remain unrealized. Others may miss out on valuable knowledge that could empower them, just as you were empowered by those who spoke before you. Your silence could create a void where someone else needed guidance, leaving them feeling isolated in their struggles without the chance to learn from your journey.
In that way, your willingness to share can create a ripple effect where others feel encouraged to voice their thoughts and experiences as well. This mutual exchange fosters a community where everyone is learning from one another, breaking the isolation that often comes with personal struggles. By contributing your insights, you not only validate your own journey but also empower others to embark on their paths towards understanding and growth. Your voice plays a crucial role in this ecosystem of support and transformation, reminding us all of the interconnectedness of our experiences.
It's true that many people underestimate their impact and importance. Expressing ourselves openly and honestly fosters genuine connections and encourages others to do the same. Embracing our authentic selves can lead to a greater understanding among individuals, creating a space where everyone feels valued and heard.
Your voice matters in fostering understanding and connection.

> [!ai]+ `11/18/2024, 9:46:29 AM`
> 💭 **Prompt**: "I'm aiming to achieve some research and some certainty about the way I'm getting my needs met. Stoble membership, followed by getting another Airbnb (maybe) or just looking at the stuff I have in Storage and categorizing it and starting to sell it. I might not need money soon. That's a weird thing to think about."

It sounds like you have a solid plan in mind for addressing your needs. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Research**: Focus on your [[Stoble membership]] and its benefits.
2. **Airbnb**: Consider if it's necessary or if organizing your storage could suffice.
3. **Selling Items**: Categorizing and selling your stored items could free up space and possibly generate income.

Reflecting on your choices can lead to clarity and ensure you're making the best decisions for your situation. Good luck!
