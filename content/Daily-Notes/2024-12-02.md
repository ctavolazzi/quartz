## üìù Daily Reflections

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 07:54`
So it begins.
I'm clocking in to the 8am Morning Coffee Hour 
I'm aware of how my views are right, and how others can't quite get there yet, even if I give them all the right information. They will still always choose whatever is most comfortable to them. It's wrong, but it's human. Maybe human means "the ability to be wrong on purpose?"

#### Model Context Protocol
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction
Standardized way to have ANY LLM connect with external tools and data sources.
Ben says: the context window is REALLY small, but it can control and edit documents on your computer. It's super easy to set up, took about 30 minutes of arguing with Claude to do it.
TK hears back on Friday about the tech program they applied for!!
So exciting!
This is like a 8am daily groupchat podcast thing hahaha
I love it so much
[[Moxie]] company is apparently going bankrupt

That little robot is going bankrupt and shutting down. Sounds like an awesome moment for the hacker community to show their stuff!

The new Claude update is already agentic. It can already operate my computer.
Top 3 consistent predictions in the space:
1) Infinite context windows
2) Agnetic AI
3) Embodied AI

My Predictions:
4) BCI becomes the normal method of operating computers
5) Humans fuse their bodies with hardware augmentations
6) Societal schism in the next 5 years inevitable

Darren is using AutoGen with Linux and allowing it to run on his local machine. He's wondering about the differences between AutoGen and MCP in terms of their code execution protocols and principles.

What's the purpose of Social Media?
- To collect data to train AI

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 09:28`
There was a test where scientists were able to extract the contents of a silent movie from your brainwaves.

Ben says the Intro to AI thing was a great easy way to judge if the Multiverse School is legit or if it's a sketchy Internet thing.

"I went to coding school and I thought I was gonna have a job right out of it, and I didn't and now it's just expensive on the back end now too."

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 10:00`
Ok that was great as always, and now I'm gonna stretch my legs, go for a ride on the scooter, go get some Yoga work done on my body, and then I'm coming back here to Stoble to work on my YouTube channel!!!

I'm SO STOKED this has truly been an incredible time. I'm honored to see that people want to spend their time with me week after week so early in the morning. They must be getting a LOT of value from this. I'm thrilled to be here with such incredible people.

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 14:30`
Alright sick. We did it. This is the new routine:
I don't like having something to do in the afternoon, I'm ***OK*** with clocking in in the morning to do an 8-10 but it's not idea. I don't want to be up that early working and talking to people every day. I want to lay in bed and let my back and my body heal.
I pushed myself WAY too hard for WAY too long. Now I'm capable and so fucking educated, but I'm not able to keep up the rate of productivity I had. I'm just not there yet.

I'm about to begin. I'm nervous.

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 15:10`
Ok I did it without spiraling. Holy shit. Wow. That was HARD but I did it without spiraling into self-loathing. 

I have 2 hours to go until I need to clock back in for the afternoon session to see if anyone even shows up, but I'm thinking that doing this thing where I simply vibe out for this week, and then do the morning coffee hour and a weekly happy hour that is more structured around people sharing what they did that week, I think we will be wildly successful :)

YouTube commentary on current events will be my thing for a while.

Let's fucking do this! I'm so pumped! That was so fun!!!
I used [[Descript]] to record and edit a video SUPER fast, and I was able to actually get it to download and be ready for publishing in under an hour!

I recorded a little 3 minute long video reaction to Descript and now I'm gonna pop that bad boy in to CapCut to add a shitload of effects, and then I'll be building the muscle one day at a time!!!
I REALLY did it!!!!!!

I just had to wait for two thing:
a) for the software to be ready, so that I didn't have to fight with it every goddamn day
b) for me to be ready, so I didn't need to fight the software

This is going to work. This is it man. You've arrived. You're here. You're ready. You finally have everything you need. You've arrived my friend. Welcome <3
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-02 at 3.14.12 PM.png]]

Descript > CapCut > YouTube

Easy as that

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 16:51`
Ok I'm about to hop on for probably the last evening Multiverse School thing I'll do for a while, and then I'll be on once a week in the evening for a weekly happy hour (probably on Wednesday) in the afternoon time to just chill with everybody and vibe out, then I'll do the 4 days off thing again, maybe work a job, maybe just go hard as fuck on YouTube, but tonight I'm about to hop back in, say howdy, chill out for an hour, and then I'm going to go back over to the Allies Pub cuz that was a vibe and I'll bring my laptop and I'll do some writing. I'll plan. I'll scheme and plot and work and do stuff.

THEN - I'll start writing for Surviving the Singularity INSIDE Obsidian, in my vault right here.

That's right dear reader: you can read [[Surviving the Singularity]] right there for free.

Let it roll.

I'm an anti-capitalist and I believe that the Singularity will blend all data together anyway. Copyright is a relic of a bygone era. The age of AI is here, and we are woefully unprepared for it.

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 16:58`
I'm ready. I'm willing. And I sure as fuck am able. Let's do this pardner. I'm down as fuck.

Here's the [Descript link](https://share.descript.com/view/7zVMB0WH0QC) to the first video I shot today inside [[Descript]] and HO BOY am I stoked. That process is actually gonna save me so much time and energy. I can't believe software like that exists!!!

For the longest time I've just been straight-up intimidated by video editors. They're too much!! They have all these buttons and hidden techniques and there's a billion YouTubers out there who all tell you the "best way" to use each editor and to be honest with you it's EXHAUSTING. I get massive decision fatigue each time I try to use one of the video editors. Even [[CapCut]] which is supposed to be the most easy.

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 17:07`
Ben says he goes to LA to go to the hardware show for music that's across the street from Disneyland called the NAM show
Ben says he feels like AI is similar to the way HipHop and Rock & Roll changed the way things are happening.
"It's like going surfing and we're catching the wave üåä"
Ben is looking at leaving the United States
I'm looking at becoming a YouTuber so that I can do the same.
Holy shit this is real. This is really happening. There's no more delusion, there's no more American exceptionalism and propaganda, this is real people doing real shit. This is so good, I'm honored to be here.

`Mon, 12/02/2024, 17:15`
Time to fuck around with [[Model Context Protocol|MCP]] I think...

> [!ai]+ `12/2/2024, 7:54:15 AM`
> üí≠ **Prompt**: "What insights can you provide about my day?"

Based on your reflections from yesterday and your plans for today, a significant insight emerges around the theme of **intentionality in your creative process**. You've expressed a desire to balance authenticity with strategic content creation, particularly as you navigate the evolving landscape of digital engagement.

Reflecting on your thoughts about lifestyle content versus SEO-driven videos, it's clear you're considering not just what resonates with the audience, but also how your unique voice can shine through. This is a pivotal moment for you to harness the power of intentionality‚Äîdeciding not just what to create, but *why* you‚Äôre creating it and how it aligns with your personal journey as "thecoffeejesus."

As you embark on this journey, consider the following:

1. **Set Clear Intentions**: Before diving into your content creation, take a moment to define what you want your audience to feel or learn. This clarity will guide your storytelling and help you maintain authenticity amid the noise.

2. **Embrace Experimentation**: While you‚Äôre contemplating the balance of personality and strategy, don‚Äôt shy away from experimenting. Your reflections indicate a willingness to try new styles and formats. Allow yourself the freedom to iterate, learn, and adapt as you go.

3. **Document the Journey**: Just as you‚Äôve been sharing your thoughts on the creative process, consider documenting your evolution as a creator. This not only serves as a reflective practice for you but also builds a narrative that your audience can connect with.

4. **Prioritize Connection**: Remember that the essence of your content lies in connection. Strive to foster a relationship with your audience that goes beyond mere consumption; invite them into your journey and encourage dialogue.

By focusing on these aspects, you can transform your creative output into a meaningful expression of your experiences and aspirations. This intentionality will not only enhance your productivity but also cultivate a deeper sense of fulfillment in your work. Embrace this opportunity to grow both personally and professionally, and let your unique perspective shine through each piece of content you create.
