## 📝 Daily Reflections

Sat, 11/16/2024, 08:26
And just like that, through sheer force of will, I have created what I conceived over a year ago.
ChatGPT can weigh in on the note I'm making AS I'M WRITING IT and provide links to other files, additional context, basically whatever I want.

This is the beginning of the ultimate content tool. This is the start of [[Winfo]] !!! The Obsidian plugin I wanted to develop all those many moons ago.

I've been developing for 5 hours. I'm sore. Why do I do this to myself?

Oh, it's because now I can fucking do THIS

`⌘ + ⇧ + G`

That's it baybeeeeeeee watch this fucking shitttttttttt 

Sat, 11/16/2024, 08:32
So as you can see, down below in the AI section, I have a context-aware GPT response call that can generate markdown, formatted properly for this environment, and add it into the file with a timestamp right underneath the AI Thoughts section.

This is the thing I wanted to do - this is the moment I've been waiting for.

As a journalist and a writer, do you have ANY IDEA how helpful this is going to be for me?

Look what I can do with this tool now.
