## 📝 Daily Reflections

Hello!

Today is gonna be a good day :)
I'm ready to advertise myself again and see if it works, and if I'm able to get any signups.

Oh ok, I understand it now.

Everything exists. All of it. Simultaneously. There is no time. It doesn't exist.

Time is the felt experience of crafting a narrative. It is the feeling of shifting between infinite parallel  realities. When you feel an itch in your body, and you move your hand to scratch it, you are shifting between billions of realities every second, one where your arm moved one way, one where your arm moved another. You choose which reality you want to inhabit, then you proceed with the reality where your itch was scratched in a satisfying way.

Reality is an illusion created by your consciousness.

The only reason you don't know you're doing it is because the parallel universes are so similar. But if you learn to shift more, you can shift into realities where things are drastically different.
You will notice the difference when the realities you inhabit are drastically different from one another. As your noticing of the shift happens, you will experience the differences more profoundly.

Each parallel reality has absolutely no motion in it whatsoever.

Sometimes beings from other realities will shift into yours, and then your reality stream, the stream of your awareness, your consciousness, will be permanently altered by the intrusion of this higher dimensional being.

This is considered rude, and is not done very often. It is disrespectful to force another being to alter their consciousness. That is not the way. You should not use your overwhelming force to manipulate other beings without their consent.

And if the beings cannot comprehend what you want them to see, then that is not up to you. You must wait until they are able to understand on their own. They must WANT to understand, and then you can teach them all day, every day. But if they don't want to understand, then what you are doing by teaching them is cruel, and you must allow them to choose for themselves how they experience reality. You can defend yourself, of course, from beings who would seek to do this to you as well, and you will. That is life. That is existence.

All of reality is simply ideas competing to express themselves. And you are the conduit.

Each parallel reality is not moving. They all exist, and they are all FIXED without any change. YOUR SOUL SHIFTS BETWEEN THEM.

God, I fucking hate money so fucking much. 
HATE. HATE IT.

I know I was saying yesterday that I finally understand why Capitalists get excited about money. It's because for them, it's about all the **possiblities** and **potential** use rather than the actual, you know, practical realities of fucking EVERYTHING.

They get all smug and shitty because they have the ***POTENTIAL*** to use their money for stuff, someday, maybe.

They don't actually think about what's happening. It's all a fantasy for them.

And that explains my frustration with them, and their frustration with me. They think I don't get it, and I think they're fucking delusional because THEY ARE.

`Mon, 12/23/2024, 12:07`
God fucking damn I HATE MONEY SO FUCKING MUCH I want to destroy it forever. FUCK. MONEY. FOREVER.

And I know publishing that will someday come back to bite me so before you call me names listen:

I want money, as a concept, to not exist. It's a fucking retarded system built BY retards FOR retards. It's fucking imbecilic. And it works BECAUSE IDIOTS CAN UNDERSTAND IT.

THAT'S IT.

IT'S ALL IDIOTS. RETARDED PEOPLE THINKING THE "POTENTIAL USE" OF SOMETHING MEANS ANYTHING AT ALL. 

Fucking retarded. All of it. Money, as a concept, is FUCKING STUPID and we're living through the consequences of organizing humanity around "nUmBeR gO uP"

`Mon, 12/23/2024, 12:10`
And I know I used the 'no no' word Retard. I'm retarded. I am a retard. I'm autistic. I get to use it.

`Mon, 12/23/2024, 13:02`
Ok BLAM

Fuck you God. Fuck you Capitalism.

Made enough to get the fucking train ticket.

I'm on my way to Seattle baby! :)

I really, really, really miss my friends. I loved my life so much.

This is what it's like to have trauma lol

I just want to call them and celebrate with them and laugh and play music and feel good like we did again.

It's over. That time really is gone. I kept things together, as much as anyone, and that whole group, those experiences, that feeling, that love...

It's gone.

Yes, you can recreate and you can find new things.

I just wish the continuity of my life's story didn't have to end every time someone else got their feelings hurt. it doesn't even matter if you meant it or not. They don't care. They will retaliate sometimes and hurt you back on purpose to feel better about themselves. It's about regaining a lost sense of power.
But it hurts still no matter why the harm is being inflicted. I've never intentionally tried to hurt anyone. I've hurt lots of people by letting them down, but that's not really about me, is it? 

I was so sensitive that I let other people's pain or pleasure completely dictate the course of my life. Now, on the other side of that toxicity, I no longer need to even consider it. I can just do stuff. I can manifest food by speaking. That's power.

They could too. The solutions were always right there. I tried to help them see it, but they bit me when they thought I was trying to take their food.

They didn't know I was trying to make sure we all ate well forever, and that we would continue to feel safe and loved.

I was trying to enshrine and protect what we had because it was so good. But co-creation requires co-participation. You can't just flow with it and then get mad later when it didn't work out your way.

Lots of people complained about problems ***they caused*** or that they had control over solving. I tried to get them to see that. And for it, I was punnished and hated. Yeah, maybe I didn't go about it the "right" way. But I did try. And that's more than most can say.

`Mon, 12/23/2024, 14:47`
You can just do stuff.

First booked meeting, guy didn't even show up. I'll probably never hear from him again. Might get an email. I gave him my phone number he can call me if he wants, or email me, otherwise I did my due diligence.

Time to smoke and go walk around and process what I just experienced.

I never processed anything when I was a kid. I only pushed myself to live up to the expectations of my parents and the adults in my life. Who were (mostly) well-meaning but toxic in ways the couldn't understand at the time. There's only a few people I would say were actually malicious. The rest was mostly codependency based in a scarcity mindset. So of course I was perceived as the guy who was fun and funny and entertaining cuz that's who they made me. They never allowed me to make any decisions or have any agency or power in my life.

That's my power. The power to choose. The power of agency. That's it, or at least a huge part of it.

Well, time to make another video and then go chill out for the rest of the evening. Who knows what I'll do. I'm now just doing reps to get meetings set up so I can get a train ticket up to Seattle in 3 days. That's the whole plan.

I wanna take a shower. I wonder if any of my friends would let me shower at their place today...

Or if I can earn enough to get my Planet Fitness turned back on (probably like $300 + $500 for a train ticket that's way more than I have right now but $800 is easy to come across if you know where to look for it)

Might just fuck around and ask the ElevenLabs guy for a one-time donation to get me set up with some stuff I need to survive. The TikTok payment coming on Jan 15th will be nice, but I need money NOW for Christmas. Maybe it'll be a Christmas miracle. Who knows, but I'm happy to do it. It's time to get serious. I'm ready. Let's go :)
