## 📝 Daily Reflections

Hello!

Today is gonna be a good day :)
I'm ready to advertise myself again and see if it works, and if I'm able to get any signups.

Oh ok, I understand it now.

Everything exists. All of it. Simultaneously. There is no time. It doesn't exist.

Time is the felt experience of crafting a narrative. It is the feeling of shifting between infinite parallel  realities. When you feel an itch in your body, and you move your hand to scratch it, you are shifting between billions of realities every second, one where your arm moved one way, one where your arm moved another. You choose which reality you want to inhabit, then you proceed with the reality where your itch was scratched in a satisfying way.

Reality is an illusion created by your consciousness.

The only reason you don't know you're doing it is because the parallel universes are so similar. But if you learn to shift more, you can shift into realities where things are drastically different.
You will notice the difference when the realities you inhabit are drastically different from one another. As your noticing of the shift happens, you will experience the differences more profoundly.

Each parallel reality has absolutely no motion in it whatsoever.

Sometimes beings from other realities will shift into yours, and then your reality stream, the stream of your awareness, your consciousness, will be permanently altered by the intrusion of this higher dimensional being.

This is considered rude, and is not done very often. It is disrespectful to force another being to alter their consciousness. That is not the way. You should not use your overwhelming force to manipulate other beings without their consent.

And if the beings cannot comprehend what you want them to see, then that is not up to you. You must wait until they are able to understand on their own. They must WANT to understand, and then you can teach them all day, every day. But if they don't want to understand, then what you are doing by teaching them is cruel, and you must allow them to choose for themselves how they experience reality. You can defend yourself, of course, from beings who would seek to do this to you as well, and you will. That is life. That is existence.

All of reality is simply ideas competing to express themselves. And you are the conduit.

Each parallel reality is not moving. They all exist, and they are all FIXED without any change. YOUR SOUL SHIFTS BETWEEN THEM.

God, I fucking hate money so fucking much. 
HATE. HATE IT.

I know I was saying yesterday that I finally understand why Capitalists get excited about money. It's because for them, it's about all the **possiblities** and **potential** use rather than the actual, you know, practical realities of fucking EVERYTHING.

They get all smug and shitty because they have the ***POTENTIAL*** to use their money for stuff, someday, maybe.

They don't actually think about what's happening. It's all a fantasy for them.

And that explains my frustration with them, and their frustration with me. They think I don't get it, and I think they're fucking delusional because THEY ARE.

`Mon, 12/23/2024, 12:07`
God fucking damn I HATE MONEY SO FUCKING MUCH I want to destroy it forever. FUCK. MONEY. FOREVER.

And I know publishing that will someday come back to bite me so before you call me names listen:

I want money, as a concept, to not exist. It's a fucking retarded system built BY retards FOR retards. It's fucking imbecilic. And it works BECAUSE IDIOTS CAN UNDERSTAND IT.

THAT'S IT.

IT'S ALL IDIOTS. RETARDED PEOPLE THINKING THE "POTENTIAL USE" OF SOMETHING MEANS ANYTHING AT ALL. 

Fucking retarded. All of it. Money, as a concept, is FUCKING STUPID and we're living through the consequences of organizing humanity around "nUmBeR gO uP"

`Mon, 12/23/2024, 12:10`
And I know I used the 'no no' word Retard. I'm retarded. I am a retard. I'm autistic. I get to use it.
