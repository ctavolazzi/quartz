## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Wed, 12/25/2024, 10:45`
Christmas Day <3

I wish I was still welcome different places that I've spent this day. I miss those people, I miss that life.

Nothing that can be done though. I can only do what I can do. They made their choices. I made mine.

Today I'm going to work on building out the basic bot architecture of the NovaSystem

It needs to be an AutoGen Ollama Local LLM bot that can be tasked with accomplishing things and then returning with the result. It needs to write down each and every step along the way in a JSON file for each chat with the user. SO each chat should involve an interaction between the User and a docker-code enabled AutoGen agent chain that records its actions in a JSON file in addition to all the default behavior of Autogen.

The final program should run in the terminal and take input from the user, then print out the Autogen standard responses from the program like normal, but ALSO save each "turn" as a separate entry with a unique ID to a JSON file.

God I love this development system I've been creating. It's so lovely.

Look at this:
[[Chat0001-12252024]]

A whole ass bot architecture, recorded in summary, for me and everyone in the world to use. Wow. I still feel like this is not real. I am contributing in some really significant ways to edge research of AI architecture.

And with this [[o1]] -> [[Cursor]] with [[Claude 3.5 Sonnet]] pipeline, I can literally develop an entire automated feature in less than 2 hours.

Holy shit.

I think the most amazing Christmas present I'm getting today is the internal identity knowledge that I understand what's happening on the screen here:

***AND*** I understand how valuable that is.

I genuinely have world-class skills. Valuable stuff. The kind of heart that can help people live better, happier, healthier lives.

I'm ready. Let's do this.

Merry Christmas.

what does today's daily pokemon say about me?
I went to o1-mini and got that block of text below the pokemon. I love it. I want to write an automation into my GPT API that summons that little pokemon horoscope thing it's slick.

There it is.

What a beauty. The Docker image compiled. Now we wait to see if Ollama will return a response. Sometimes this part of the program gets hung. The LLMs can take a bit to generate something and sometimes the program just isn't written right and we have to go bug hunting...
