## 📝 Daily Reflections

Ok, if I did it right...this should work.
Voila, behold:
[[WE2222-1117-2024]]
A new work effort, created from a python script. Soon to be created by my [[WinfoNova]] plugin * cue laughter *

Nova will be able to: create documents, make work efforts, do work on them, follow up on those work efforts, process that stuff, and keep track of it, spin up custom one-time-use AI models and [[AI Agent Swarm]] workflows to create custom, scalable, trackable workflows to make everything and anything you want. [[vSLAM]] will provide the power to the bodies that Nova will pilot. 
This could become [[Skynet]]. We must tread lightly.

[[NovaSystem Example - Nova builds Nova]] is such a fantastic example of what I'm trying to build. I think I can probably just honestly build it on top of [[Jira]] hahaha boy developers would HATE me but it would probably work. The Jira API is super reliable and widely used for a reason.

NovaSystem is intended to be a knowledge management system for people who think a little differently. It's an AI enhanced autonomous, self-udating system that uses publidly available FREE APIs to aggregate knowlege for you on any topic, train a custom AI model JUST for YOU, that is private, offline, and capable of chatting with you about anything (within reason and legal limits). 

Nova grows with you, so as you learn things and teach them to Nova, Nova learns what your learn and knows what you know. If also is private and fully controllable. If you want Nova to forget something, it can actaully forget, forever.

Nova is a true personal private knowledge assistant. People will be impressed with how much stuff you're able to handle, just because you decided to take the plunge into AI with Nova.

Let your AI assistant stay on top of the News, the Politics, all the stuff you don't want poisoning your mind and stealing your precious dopamine away, and focus on what truly matters to you, resting easy in the peace of mind knowling that AI has your back and that any alerts necessary will be processed and dealt with, without you needing to tear yourself away from enjoying your life to monitor it.

Trust that the system will help you, but don't blindly rely on it fo reverything. You are still in charge. It's like people who think that Autopilot means "I can go into the back and have a party!" Nope. You still need to be in charge and on top of your stuff, but Nova will help you feel less overwhelmed.

There's simply too much still foung on to be aware of and on top of for any one human to manage it. There's a reason why ther task management industry is a multi-billion dollar industry! There's too many tasks!

Offload some of them to Nova. Let the AI help you remember what you forgot. Capture everything and train your own personal model on it, and then make it vanish in the blink of an eye if you want your privacy back. Easy peasy. 

The 3 Ps of AI: 
Possible, Permitted, Preferred. This will provide the vibe check needed to help make everything fucking rock!

This is it chat.
This is the moment.
I'm about to do it for the very first time - connecting a [[NovaSystem]] development session with a published [[Obsidian Vault]] with [[Quartz]]
Holy shit. This is it. This is the moment.
System Boot...

Onix was always one of my favorite pokemon when I was a kid. It's oly fitting that it's today's Pokémon :)
TOday is the first test of the NovaSYstem. It's an accessibility system for people like me who deal with chronic pain. The system works primarily through voice, providing an easy way to manage your knowledge and work with AI models to accomplish more work than an average person with fewer keystrokes, fewer mistakes, lower environmental impact, and significantly lower cost.

Let's begin.

## NovaSystem Demonstration

#### 1) Talk to ChatGPT
Get started by talking to [[ChatGPT]] about whatever is on your mind.
- Use the [[NovaSystem]] prompt to better steer the conversation and maximize the value you're able to extract from your turns with the model. 
- Think of it as "Mining for Intelligence" or "Mining for Insight"
- Repeat, repeat, iterate, iterate

#### 2) Copy / Paste that conversation into Obsidian
Using a variety of plugins you can create a markdown formatted page with lots of internal links, hashtags, and external links, tables, and all kinds of formatted, structured data.
Here is an example:
[[NovaSystem Example - Nova builds Nova]]

#### 3) Use the structured markdown formatting and autolinking features of Obsidian to create a beautiful Knowledge Garden to extract from the AI what it knows
Copy / Paste is your best friend
- Get granular with it
- The models are trained on a surprisingly large amount of specialized info. Queries bring it out, but conditions change.
- Extract the knowledge and immortalize it in an Obsidian vault with easy structure for AI scraping later

#### 4) Keep mining for intel
Using Quartz or Obsidian Publish youcan create a system where you can easily publish your work extracting knowledge and put it back int o an other model to keep extracting
- Add a "📋 Copy Text" button to your site to easily expand your work from wherever you are
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-17 at 11.56.40 AM.png]]

- Literally just use Cursor to make all the edits you need.
- Switch back and forth between the Cursor and Obsidian editors to maximize your velocity

Using this method I was able to publish {num} pages related to the NovaSystem in under {minutes}

Try it out for yourself
