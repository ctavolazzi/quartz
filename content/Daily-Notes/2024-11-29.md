## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 09:20`
Alright
Day 1
I'm a YouTuber

It literally just is that simple. I just decide that I am, and viola, I am. I don't need anyone else to approve me, I don't need someone to walk me through or give me permission (well, I need YouTube's permission, but that's it).
I can just start making videos. Today. From anywhere in the world.
I know the format, I know the formula, I know the culture and the lay of the land. I mean, Christ, some of these kids coming up in the YouTube scene weren't even ALIVE when I started watching YouTube videos.

The platform was founded on Valentine's Day 2005, 3 years before I lost my virginity. I was a Christian School Boy ok don't judge me. I was **sheltered**.
We had dial up internet in a ***very*** rural area and I remember calling up a Star Wars video, waiting literally overnight for it to buffer, and then watching it in the morning before school so I could talk to my friends about it. If anyone picked up the phone at any point then the process was ruined and I was doomed to be a social pariah at school that day.

And now, today, for the first time, I am considering myself to be a YouTuber. I am finally, FINALLY ready to start making content for real. For my audience. For myself. 

I'm ready.

Are you?

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 10:14`
Holy shit this is fun
I'm loading Buffer up with all my post ideas. This is working. It's getting engagement. Holy fucking shit this is ***EASY*** too! Literally as I'm browsing the net, I just screengrab whatever I like and 

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 10:39`
I met an interesting man named [[Randy Wilcoxen]] today at [[Mom's]] while I was sitting and writing. He was timid, but as I opened up about what I do, we began talking about tech. His eyes lit up and he said "Look up D-Wave quantum, you're gonna love this."
And he was right, I did, indeed, love it.
I'm currently watching him pray sincerely over his food. I love this man. He said "I married a woman I wasn't supposed to marry, that's how I think of it. We had a son together."
Then he showed me his family crest:

![](https://www.houseofnames.com/dpreview/WILCOXEN/SC/Wilcoxen/family-crest-coat-of-arms.png)
He said it's where the phrase "Semper fidelis" was first coined. 

He showed me this: [[D-Wave]]

 I'm getting reminders from the universe at every turn that becoming a YouTube health and futurism creator is my fate. I'm so happy man. Being the town crier is literally what I was made for. I'm SO ready. FINALLY I'll be taken seriously and treated with the respect that Randy just treated me with as I unlock people's limitations and teach them to empower themselves.
 
`Fri, 11/29/2024, 10:49`
God I'm SO fucking ready for this.

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 11:06`
Systems on systems on systems on systems
We often conflate the natural order of things with the systems we've constructed.
What is the deepest state of something? What is its core?
If everyone around the coal mine gets phlegm in their throats in the morning, is that a symptom of the way their lungs work, or is it more about the fact that there's a fucking coal mine nearby??
This is how I feel about Capitalism.

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 11:18`
Ok the more I look into this D-Wave stuff the more I realize this is fucking legit. They're doing quantum inference at the enterprise scale. Holy fuck.

It's never going to stop impressing me that I coded that. I build the little integration that allows me to now hit `cmd + shift + G` and then type a silly little command and have an image like that.
In literally a decade or less I'm going to be piloting a mech suit with my mind.
I'm not ready...but here we fucking go.

**YouTube manifestation dream activate!**
Form of...A ***TECHNOMANCER***!

And I'm gonna show y'all how to do it too. Fuck this is so fucking exciting. God DAMN this is SO COOL I'm fucking ready man.

>*"Hey aren't you that Coffee Jesus guy? The 'Gotta Know Guy' or whatever? Hell yeah man wow I saw your video where you _____ that shit was incredible man. Changed my life."

That's one side of what I'm in store for. Here's the other:

>*"Hey aren't you that AI guy on YouTube? Yeah I've never seen any of your videos but I've seen people talk about you. Do you really think AI is a good thing? I mean I know it's completely eliminated cancer and again and whatever the hell else but I kinda hate you. I don't like AI. Fuck AI and fuck YOU.

That the other side. Neo-luddites will absolutely try to kill me. Competitors too. I will need to be fully insured and fully safe as I build. I will need to prioritize security as I get bigger.

But this is the path for me. This is my destiny. I could have been this inspirational, aspirational figure had I simply shot my shot when I was in the spotlight of Chico. Now it's gonna take a lot more time, but I'll be FULLY invested and FULLY aware of what I'm doing the whole time. I'm no longer a naive little baby. I'm not discovering things as I go along. It's been a few years since I was doing stuff with everyone and partying and doing shows and making it all happen. 
Now I'm ready to take it to the next level, but it's a little different. It's no longer about the rush or the celebration. It's about the future and building a runway so that the kids I see all around me today have a fucking chance.
People are so down and out and in their feels about themselves that  I literally never see people online talking about how we need to make a better world for the kids. I never see it. No one, zero people, saying "We need to make a better world for the kids of tomorrow." Everyone, literally everyone, saying "We're fucked lol haha"
What kind of message does that send to the kids?

As I journal and keep track of my day in this nifty little sidebar app (Obsidian is docked on my laptop screen [[Obsidian + Buffer Workflow|look]]) I am finding that I have many, many thoughts that I want to turn into posts.
Before I wanted to devote time to each post as an artistic expression. I wanted my soul to come through and be noticeable in every post.
Now, I see how that was a bad use of my time. I understand scaling now.
I feel how much better I feel not staring at the tiny blue hypnosis machine.
I can **feel** how much better my mental clarity is. I feel less fatigued. My skull isn't tired. My eyes are not exhausted from midromovements scanning the tiny screen all day, scrutinizing it like a gemstone meant for a king. 
I am measurable more productive as a content creator using this system. By several orders of magnitude.
Obsidian + Buffer + AI is fucking \*Chef's Kiss\*

Here's a Tweet from this very entry right here:
```
Journaling in Obsidian has unlocked a flood of ideas for posts! 🌊 I used to pour my soul into every single one, but now I realize that's not the best use of my time. I'm feeling clearer, less fatigued, and way more productive—Obsidian + Buffer + AI is 🔥! #ContentCreation #Productivity
```

All I do is copy/paste with this little button right here in the top right:
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 11.59.23 AM.png]]
Then in Buffer I can make a new post by clicking the "+ New" button or I can simply press `N + P` and viola, a post is born and published simultaneously to every platform.

1. Make a New Post on Buffer
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 11.59.42 AM.png]]

2. Select the platforms where you want to publish the post
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 12.00.56 PM.png]]

3. Add your content
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 12.03.41 PM.png]]

4. Customize the post for each platform (if you wish)
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 12.04.22 PM.png]]

5. Add the posts to your Queue
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 12.05.03 PM.png]]

6. The Queue will add your post to the calendar in the next available time slot for each platform
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 12.06.10 PM.png]]

7. You can inspect and customize the Queue for each platform. The Queue is the killer feature of Buffer.
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-29 at 12.07.54 PM.png]]
*There it is! Scheduled to post on [[Threads]] at 12:34pm and on [[Twitter]] at 1:30pm, and I didn't have to open either app.*

This is the future. This is how it's gonna work in the future. You'll take your content and your followers with you across platforms. They will belong to you, on your own blockchain, and will be decentralized and transferrable.

Made it to [[Naked Lounge]]
I see now how this was the place for me for so long.
I'm saving so much time today. 
I just picked up a little conversation trick from this guy who is always in Naked Lounge.
"Slumlord Endorphins" 
He's writing a book called "The Lobby of Consciousness"
This is so cool.
"You're not overweight, you're carrying around a bunch of slumlord endorphins! You're in control, not them."

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 13:50`
Had a ROARING conversation with [[David L. Boos]] he told me about something called [[Optogenetics]]
This seems significant.

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 14:34`
Had a great conversation with [[Addison Winslow]] about social media! I did some consulting for him on how to optimize his social media game.

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 16:46`
Just had a fantastic download with Addison. I got him to sit through the AI conversation hahahaha
I drew some stuff. It's messy as hell lol but it depicted the way I see the world quite accurately. He sat through it and I could see he was actually thinking about it. I got his [[Overton Window]] to open up just a little bit.
Fantastic work I'm extremely deeply gratified by the way it played out.
He asked good questions, and only on a few issues did he put up resistance to the ideas.
People will come around in time. All I need to do now is build myself up on YouTube.

The Game is Set. 

I just lit the match.

Time to blow a fuse, or run enough juice through these ideas that I finally blow up.

I'm doing it. Finally. Without permission, without asking anyone, I'm just fucking DOING it.

I'm gonna fail. I'm gonna fall on my face. I'm going to fuck it up.

I don't care.

This is going to be the final, most impactful, greatest journey of my entire life, and I'm here for it.

It's time.

I keep saying that, but god DAMN, is it TIME. I finally understand the feelings I have and how to use them for the benefit of the people around me. FINALLY I have what I need to become the person I've always been inside.

The outside is going to finally match the inside. I'm ready. I'm SO fucking ready.

Let's do this :)

`Fri, 11/29/2024, 16:52`
I have over 56 posts scheduled to go live over the next 48 hours. Holy shit. This is incredible. 
I feel so relieved. This is going to take care of the shit I need it to take care of while I simply exist the way I've been existing for years.
[[Buffer]] truly is the level-up I've been waiting for.

Now I just need to focus. Conversions. [[Surviving the Singularity]] and the rest of it are the next version of my life. I'll do the thing, sell the stuff, and then come out on top later.

I'll need an actual job to sustain me while I'm waiting to grow, but at the end of the day, I'll win. This is a long game, and I'm positioned to play my hand at just the right moment.

It's been over a decade of learning since I landed here in Chico, and I now know I'm almost certainly autistic. I'm perfectly ok with that. I'm ready to roll man fuck the haters and fuck God it made me this way so I could be this way and I'm embracing it as a wiser, older, more seasoned, more powerful man.

I'm going to make myself into who I've longed to be the whole time.

I always just wanted friends, and I was willing to do anything to keep them. Even making myself small and silly to keep people around. I rarely revealed my authentic self.

I'm finally ready. I see my value. I see who and what I can become if I try hard enough. I see how I can make the impact I've been longing to make in my own community if I align myself with [[Addison Winslow|Addison]] and [[Bryce Goldstein|Bryce]] and [[Katie Hawley|Katie]] I will, with 100% certainty, achieve my dreams. I can feel that in my gut the same way I felt like keeping the Gentle Bull community alive would yield me the dreams and hopes I'd had since I was a child, the same way I felt the [[Mandate of Heaven]] leave me when I failed.

I can feel it, like the gentle breathy kisses of a soft summer day. I can sense it like you might sense the early days of fall when the leaves start to turn and the smell starts to change. The toroids of cosmic energy are roiling all around me and I can sense their favor returning, if yet tepid, but soon converted into majesty for all to see and enjoy.

I was [[Chico's Golden Boy]] for years, and then I became [[Chico's AI Pariah]]. I became [[Chico's Influencer]]
 and next I will fully embody my pending, essential role as [[Chico's YouTuber]].

Every town needs one. I guess I'm it.

>***"Can we trust him?"***

They ask.

>***"Does it matter?"***

They also say.

>***"He's the only game in town, let's at least hear him out. He's managed to get this far..."***

That's my future. Fighting the resistance of the people around me, while simultaneously pushing the veil of ignorance backward online.

It's a HARD life, chosen.

I asked for wisdom, and now I'm getting it.

I asked for wisdom in 1997 when I was 8 in the 3rd grade. I got it. I have the wisdom. Now I need the resources.

Had I gotten the resources when I was deep in the Matrix I would have squandered them on my friends.

With 100% certainty I would have given people everything I had to keep them from abandoning me like my family did.

Now, I see my own value, in ways I never every have, and I feel like I'm ready to become who I've always been.

I'll absolutely rub LOTS of people the wrong way. I'll be a polarizing figure for sure, but hopefully I'll be more like [[George Carlin]] than [[Bill Maher]] but only time will tell.

What I will be, always, from now on, is 100% myself. Always. Without fail. I will **always** from now on forever more, be the person I am inside, and whatever people think about me is their business.

Fuck 'em. Those who get it will get it.

Everyone else can come back to me when they're ready.

*Please work...*


> [!ai]+ `11/29/2024, 9:20:19 AM`
> 💭 **Prompt**: "What insights can you provide about my day?"

Based on your recent reflections and the transition you are making into a YouTube career, it’s clear that you are at a significant crossroads filled with potential for both personal growth and creativity. One insightful perspective to consider is the concept of **intentionality in content creation**.

As you embark on this journey, think about how each piece of content you create can serve a larger purpose that aligns with your values and aspirations. This intentional approach can enhance not only the quality of your videos but also your personal satisfaction with the process. Just like brewing the perfect cup of coffee, where each element matters—from the type of beans to the brewing method—each aspect of your content creation should reflect your unique voice and the message you want to convey.

You’ve previously mentioned leveraging tools and techniques that improve efficiency. Consider establishing a clear framework for your video production, perhaps by defining themes or topics that resonate deeply with you and your audience. This can help maintain focus and streamline your creative process, allowing you to produce content that is not only engaging but also fulfilling.

Moreover, as you navigate potential challenges, remember that every experience—whether positive or negative—can be transformed into valuable content. Embrace this mindset, and you may find that the journey itself becomes as rewarding as the destination. 

Ultimately, aligning your content with your passion for technology and coffee can create a unique niche that sets you apart. Let your creativity flow, and don't hesitate to experiment as you refine your style and voice. This is your moment to shine, so seize it with confidence!
