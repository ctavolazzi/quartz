## 📝 Daily Reflections

`Wed, 12/11/2024, 08:33`
The new Google Quantum Willow computer is reducing costs by as much as 90% across the board.

>Katie: In the past, if we wanted to make a new material, we had to have a scientist go through decades of learning and experimentation, and come up with the idea for a new material, test and engineer the molecules, and then labor over time, sleep, eat, and survive, and then we would have one new material.
>Quantum computers could synthesize new materials at almost unimaginable scales. A scalable quantum computer could synthesize almost any material in seconds. It could do centuries of research and development in a moment. You could ask it for clear aluminum and it could simultaneously try every possible permutation of the individual molecules until it finds the most stable one. It could test to make sure every material is hypoallergenic, sustainable, and perfect.

Look into this one there's a significant chance this will work for me:
https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/357664

The government has grants for small businesses, minorities, women, victimized communities, people who experienced specific events, ethnic communities, and specific outcomes that the government wants to see happen.

>"*High impact interdisciplinary studies into..."*
>*"National Institute of Bla Bla Bla funding to expand understanding about biomechanical function of..."

#### We are NOT a 501(c)3
Could we stand up a 501(c)3 really quickly? Yes, absolutely. Would it be worth it? Only if we have a specific grant we're relatively certain we could get.

There are MANY and funding for certain things is not likely to dry up.

For example:
#### Addressing Food Deserts
That's it. That's the mission. That's the calling.

I'm going to use automation to feed more people and address food deserts through a 501(c)3. Maybe the[[18 Oaks Foundation]]. Maybe something else. Idk. I think I want 18 Oaks to stand as my estate, my legacy org.

# Funding Options for Me
