## 📝 Daily Reflections

The new Google Quantum Willow computer is reducing costs by as much as 90% across the board.

>Katie: In the past, if we wanted to make a new material, we had to have a scientist go through decades of learning and experimentation, and come up with the idea for a new material, test and engineer the molecules, and then labor over time, sleep, eat, and survive, and then we would have one new material.
>Quantum computers could synthesize new materials at almost unimaginable scales. A scalable quantum computer could synthesize almost any material in seconds. It could do centuries of research and development in a moment. You could ask it for clear aluminum and it could simultaneously try every possible permutation of the individual molecules until it finds the most stable one. It could test to make sure every material is hypoallergenic, sustainable, and perfect.
