# Daily Note

This is going to become something grand, I can already feel it
I have all the skills necessary to begin this next block of work - building a robot gardener is the next goal and it is right on the horizon. I'm ready, it's time, let's fucking do this!

I'm going to work on building robot gardeners with Johnny Autoseed, and I'm starting the real process today.
I can build my notes on aiecotech.org and then point an AI LLM at the site and it will know what I know.
I can use the Obsidian app on my computer to edit the text files in this Github repo I made to host Quartz, and by doing that I can use a familiar and robust and secure and stable system, Obsidian, to make my notes, record my thoughts, and make them available to the world and to every AI in it, and by doing so increase my chances and my opportunities, while simultaneously keeping myself safe from bullshit.

This is the beginning. 

It starts today.

[[Mobile-ALOHA]] is the greatest thing I've seen yet.

[[Mobile-ALOHA]] that's the link but it's not working on the main page for some reason. Idk. Oh well

Ok as a developer log, this rocks. The workflow here is fucking amazing.

I have a [[ChatGPT]] window open and [[Claude Projects]] on deck with a templatized version of the documents we're using here in this app. 

I can simply word vomit with my actual voice, or I just type stuff into the [[Obsidian]] app. I can then take the stuff from here and dump it into ChatGPT to make a table of contents and a list of articles to generate, all in markdown format. Then I take that into [[Claude]] and have it use the template already stored in memory to generate the project files.

One by one I add them to the Claude Project memory, and using the magnificent [[RAG]] app that [[Anthropic]] built, I can generate a thorough, accurate, and robust [[Knowledge Garden]] like this one from a single interlinked page.

From this, I can show other people what I know and have learned cleanly. It allows asynchronous transparency at the highest level.

I can also point an AI at the website and have it crawl the page. I've specifically engineered this website to be easy to crawl so that future AI models can easily get up to speed on who I am and what I stand for and find me opportunities that would have otherwise been missed or overlooked.

I foresee others learning and adapting this model of doing business; derived from the idea of "poisoning" the model to sabotage it, "seeding" the model involves generating as much information as you possibly can about yourself with the hopes that future AI models scraping the Internet will include you in a future response generation.

[[Seeding AI Models]] will be to the future Internet, what [[SEO]] was to the past.

ANYway...let's set up [[novasystem-io]] to be a custom adapter API over the top of my Supabase database

That's scary...I hope the Supabase holds and I don't fuck this up...

Let's engineer some Auth!

https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth

I'm going to learn about the Supabase auth. Rather than bully the AI into doing what I want it to do, I'm going to actually be a developer and READ the DOCS (sigh)

Ok here we go...

Alright, there's several ways to do auth in Supabase. One is [[Next.js]], which is the first Getting Strated guide. 

There are other ways, using other services, and I'm searching for the [[SvelteKit]] version...

https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit

Ok this seems to be promising. This link seems to be a promising way to get a lead on handling Supabase operations...

Ok I activated a project. I'm not sure what to do next. I got thecoffeejesus Supabase project loaded and unpaused. Not sure what happens next...

```sql
INSERT INTO tower (name, description, floor, guardian)
VALUES 
('Arcane Relics Vault', 'Contains magical artifacts and enchanted relics.', 3, 'Aldor the Wise'),
('Spell Tome Library', 'A vast library of ancient spell tomes.', 2, 'Luna the Librarian'),
('Potion Chamber', 'A mystical room filled with potion ingredients and brews.', 1, 'Brewmaster Tannis'),
('Summoning Circle', 'Room for performing summoning rituals.', 4, 'Zara the Summoner');
```

I made a table in my Supabase project. Now I need to retrieve the data to ensure that I know how to do that...

Ok I made hella tables. Added updating functions to them. And data.

Now I'm indexing them?? Wtf is it really this easy now??

Ok I think I got the database set up. There's tables, there's a Wizard's Tower with a bunch of shit in it, and now I'm going to build an API wrapper on top of it to practice.

Let's fucking do this...

Thu, 11/14/2024, 15:32
I just did a little AI powered deep dive into the Supabase with SvelteKit page
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/sveltekit

GOD I love AI. I'm about to start testing an adapter with an API that I'm building myself, in the place I learned how to do all this shit, and the journey is about to be over.

I'm about to have a database, with authentication, that I can start playing around with from anywhere in the world, and I can just start building shit.

Incredible.

> You can just do stuff, you know.

Thu, 11/14/2024, 15:54
I just got the database set up with RLS
However long that took is how long that takes. What a drain. Ugh. BUT it's all good, this is just part of the process.

Proceeding with the SQL and the stuff that we can use to create a [[FastAPI]] adapter over this or something that we can operate with SvelteKit

Thu, 11/14/2024, 16:11
Ok I got a database up and running...but I'm fucked. I can't get the data out. I'm troubleshooting...now it's hard again. Lol. It's supposed to feel this hard.

Thu, 11/14/2024, 16:37
WE DID IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

FEAST YOUR EYES:

BWA HAHAHAHA

We have PERSISTENT DATA BITCH

Ok that was a lot more annoying than I expected but IT WORKS :)

Thu, 11/14/2024, 17:16
Ok continuing the tutorial...
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit#creating-a-supabase-client-for-ssr
I'm gonna get this.

I really am...

Thu, 11/14/2024, 17:35
I *think* I have a working app.
***Heavy*** emphasis on **think**
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-14 at 5.35.51 PM.png]]

I'll know when I can pull the data from the tower table or the index and display it and allow myself to edit the values.

Uploaded that image

I think it works...

Thu, 11/14/2024, 17:39
It works. Mother. Fucker. It works.

I have a custom database-connected system that I can tweak on and build out over time. For free.
This. Is. Incredible.
Constant backups are going to be a complete necessity...but I did it. Wow.

Thu, 11/14/2024, 18:54
Just like that, my first Supabase User Auth CRUD app
Behold:
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-14 at 6.54.30 PM.png]]

It's... it's so beautiful...

![[Screen Shot 2024-11-14 at 7.16.24 PM.png]]
![[Screen Shot 2024-11-14 at 7.19.19 PM.png]]
So it begins...

Oh my god.

Hooooooly goodness.

And just like that, [[Teleport Massive]] has legs.

I'm gonna go lie down until money hits my account. I'll be back later. I need to go and think about this...

Mining for intelligence indeed.

It's almost like...if I can get my questions answered, even by a robot, then I can use my human brain to figure stuff out. What a concept. Instead of yelling at curious kids for asking questions, perhaps we should feed their curiosity.

We've had ChatGPT for 2 years and in that time I've used it to learn everything there is to know about engineering a BASIC website with RAG and Ollama support and basic AI customer support.

That's a fucking HUGE ROI.

That knowledge never leaves you. Once you have it, those lessons are inside FOREVER.

Blessed. Humbled. Honored. Grateful. Moisturized. In my lane. Thriving.
