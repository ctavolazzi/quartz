## Overview

AutoGen is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft Research that enables the creation of next-generation LLM applications using multi-agent conversations. It provides a platform for building, customizing, and deploying conversational agents powered by LLMs, tools, humans, or combinations thereof.

### Key Features {#features}

> [!info] Core Capabilities
> - **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Enables multiple agents to work together on complex tasks
> - **Flexible Architecture:** Supports diverse agent types (LLMs, humans, tools)
> - **Customizable Workflows:** Configurable conversation patterns and agent behaviors
> - **Tool Integration:** Seamless connection with external tools and APIs
> - **Human-in-the-Loop:** Built-in support for human oversight and interaction

### Real-World Applications {#applications}

> [!example] Implementation Areas
> 1. **Software Development**
>    - Multi-agent code generation
>    - Automated code review
>    - Documentation writing

## Technical Architecture {#architecture}

### Agent Types

1. **Conversable Agents**
   - Natural language communication
   - Task-specific behaviors
   - Customizable personalities

2. **Assistant Agents**
   - LLM-powered responses
   - Tool usage capabilities
   - Knowledge integration

3. **User Proxy Agents**
   - Human interaction handling
   - Input validation
   - Safety checks

### Communication Patterns {#patterns}

> [!note] Supported Patterns
> - One-to-one agent conversations
> - Group chat dynamics
> - Human-in-the-loop workflows
> - Tool-augmented interactions

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

### Installation

```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Create agents
assistant = AssistantAgent("assistant")
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy")

# Start conversation
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Let's solve a problem...")
```

## Benefits & Challenges {#benefits-challenges}
