What is AGI?

> OpenAI defines AGI as a highly autonomous system that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work

It doesn’t matter what we think about AI here in the US or any part of the West. 

China stands a serious chance at achieving AGI first. 

Most major experts are predicting that the US will achieve AGI by 2027 or sooner. These are not only the predictions of personalities like Elon Musk and others, but also this is the prediction of major financial and insurance industries around the world.

AGI is coming.

Next year we get robots. Teslas and Unitrees and Boston Dynamics and SO many more are both A) self-learning and B) getting cheaper every month

As more models of droids that can work for less than minimum wage and produce better results continue to be built and sold, what do you think is going to happen?

These droids will create more and more data to train new AI models on. And within the decade we have iRobot followed by Blade Runner and then hopefully Star Trek by 2035 (and not Terminator)

AGI will accelerate every-fucking-thing so much faster than anyone can possibly imagine. 

We’ve already seen it in chatbots. 

Give a chatbot a body and now you have FigureAI with robots fully capable of syndicated learning. The Borg are here, they are simply slow.

Now that the US election is over and we know what kind of global police force we’re gonna have we should probably start thinking about how our lives here in the US are gonna start changing a lot faster, and the amount of change and the rate and pace of change will be going up faster and faster as well.

We are in for some EXTREMELY wild times.

Sincerely unfathomable change.

The only thing I’m doing to prepare is getting really good at explaining myself with precision.

The more articulate I can be when the coming Artificial Super God arrives, the better I hope it will favor me and spare me from suffering.
