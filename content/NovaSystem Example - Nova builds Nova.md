Now, using your knowledge of AutoGen from Microsoft, begin working more on the setup and process before we dive back into WE2024-1117-2430 Here’s some context: AutoGen is a powerful framework for building AI agents and facilitating multi-agent cooperation. Here are some code examples demonstrating how to use AutoGen: ## Basic Two-Agent Conversation This example shows a simple interaction between an AssistantAgent and a UserProxyAgent:

```
python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json

# Load LLM inference endpoints
config_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")

# Create an AssistantAgent
assistant = AssistantAgent("assistant", llm_config={"config_list": config_list})

# Create a UserProxyAgent
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy", code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding"})

# Initiate a chat
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.")
```

This code sets up a basic conversation where the UserProxyAgent asks the AssistantAgent to plot a stock price chart[1]. ## Multi-Agent Conversation with Task Splitting Here's an example of a more complex multi-agent conversation that handles multiple tasks:

```
python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Create an AssistantAgent
assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant")

# Create a UserProxyAgent
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy")

# Initiate a chat with multiple questions
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="""What date is today? Which big tech stock has the largest year-to-date gain this year? How much is the gain?"""
)
```

In this example, the AssistantAgent processes the message, splits it into actionable tasks, executes them, and communicates the results back to the UserProxyAgent[1]. ## Using AutoGen with OpenAI's Assistant API AutoGen can be integrated with OpenAI's Assistant API for more advanced capabilities:

```
python
from autogen import GPTAssistantAgent

# Create a GPTAssistantAgent
gpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(
    name="Your Assistant Agent Name",
    instructions="Your Assistant Agent Instructions",
    llm_config=llm_config
)
```

This example shows how to create a GPTAssistantAgent, which can leverage the Assistant API's features like state management, context association, and code execution[2]. ## Group Chat with Multiple Agents AutoGen allows you to create group chats with multiple specialized agents:

```
python
import autogen

# Create multiple agents
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent("user_proxy")
checker = autogen.AssistantAgent("checker")
coder = autogen.AssistantAgent("coder")
commander = autogen.AssistantAgent("commander")

# Set up a group chat
groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, checker, coder, commander], messages=[], max_round=10)
manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)
```

This setup allows for more complex interactions between multiple agents, each with its own role in solving tasks[2]. ## Using AutoGen with External Tools AutoGen can integrate external tools, such as weather APIs:

```
python
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.task import Console, TextMentionTermination
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_ext.models import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

# Define a tool
async def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {city} is 73 degrees and Sunny."

# Create an agent with the tool
weather_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="weather_agent",
    model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        # api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    ),
    tools=[get_weather],
)

# Set up termination condition
termination = TextMentionTermination("TERMINATE")

# Create a team
agent_team = RoundRobinGroupChat([weather_agent])
```

This example demonstrates how to create an agent with a custom tool (in this case, a weather function) and set up a team for handling weather-related queries[3]. These examples showcase the versatility of AutoGen in creating various AI agent configurations for different tasks and scenarios. Remember to replace placeholder API keys and model names with your actual credentials when using these examples.

`# Function to handle message passing def send_message(sender_agent, recipient_agents, content, message_type):     message = {         "sender": sender_agent.name,         "recipient": [agent.name for agent in recipient_agents],         "content": content,         "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),         "message_type": message_type     }     # Simulate sending the message to each recipient     for agent in recipient_agents:         agent.receive_message(message)`

#### **2.2 Agent Message Handling**

Each agent will have a `receive_message` method to process incoming messages.

**Code Snippet:**

python

Copy code

`class AssistantAgent:     # Existing code...      def receive_message(self, message):         # Process the message based on its type and content         if message['message_type'] == "Instruction":             self.handle_instruction(message)         elif message['message_type'] == "Response":             self.handle_response(message)         elif message['message_type'] == "Analysis":             self.handle_analysis(message)         elif message['message_type'] == "Summary":             self.handle_summary(message)      def handle_instruction(self, message):         # Custom logic for handling instructions         pass      # Additional handler methods...`

**Internal Thoughts:**

- **Modularity:** Separating message handling into different methods improves code maintainability and clarity.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Implementing async functions can help manage agents' responses without blocking the system.

---

**Page Content**

### **1. Microservices Architecture Design**

#### **1.1 Architectural Overview**

We will adopt a microservices architecture where each agent runs as an independent service. This approach provides:

- **Isolation:** Agents operate in separate environments, reducing the impact of failures.
- **Scalability:** Services can be scaled independently based on load.
- **Flexibility:** Enables deployment of agents across different servers or cloud regions.

**Architecture Diagram Description:**

- **User Interface (UI):** Frontend application where users interact with the system.
- **API Gateway:** Serves as a single entry point to the backend services.
- **Agent Services:**
    - **DCE Service**
    - **CAE Service**
    - **Domain Expert Services (e.g., Software Architect, Process Analyst)**
- **Message Broker:** Manages communication between agents using message queues/topics.
- **Database:** Centralized or distributed data storage for session data, agent logs, etc.

---

#### **1.2 Service Deployment**

- **Containerization:**
    - Use Docker to containerize each agent service.
    - Define Dockerfiles specifying the environment and dependencies.

**Sample Dockerfile for an Agent Service:**

dockerfile

Copy code

`FROM python:3.9-slim  # Set working directory WORKDIR /app  # Copy requirements COPY requirements.txt .  # Install dependencies RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  # Copy application code COPY . .  # Expose port (if needed) EXPOSE 8000  # Run the service CMD ["python", "agent_service.py"]`

- **Orchestration with Kubernetes:**
    - Deploy containers using Kubernetes (K8s) for scaling and management.
    - Define Deployment and Service YAML files for each agent.

**Sample Kubernetes Deployment File:**

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: dce-agent-deployment spec:   replicas: 3   selector:     matchLabels:       app: dce-agent   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: dce-agent     spec:       containers:       - name: dce-agent-container         image: yourrepo/dce-agent:latest         ports:         - containerPort: 8000`

---

### **2. Advanced Inter-Agent Communication**

#### **2.1 Message Broker Setup**

We will use a message broker like **RabbitMQ** or **Apache Kafka** to manage message passing between agents.

    - **Asynchronous Communication:** Agents can process messages at their own pace.
    - **Reliability:** Ensures messages are delivered even if agents are temporarily unavailable.
    - **Scalability:** Supports high throughput and distributed processing.

**Message Queue Configuration:**

- **Queues/Topics:** Create queues for each agent or functional group.
- **Routing Keys:** Use routing keys to direct messages to the appropriate agents.
- **Exchange Types (for RabbitMQ):**
    - **Direct Exchange:** For one-to-one communication.
    - **Fanout Exchange:** For broadcasting messages to multiple agents.
    - **Topic Exchange:** For pattern-based routing.

---

#### **2.2 Message Structure and Protocols**

We need to define a standardized message format and protocols for inter-agent communication.

**Message Format (JSON):**

json

Copy code

`{   "message_id": "UUID",   "sender": "AgentName",   "recipient": ["AgentName"],   "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp",   "message_type": "Instruction/Response/Analysis/Summary",   "content": "Message content",   "session_id": "UUID",   "metadata": {     "priority": "High/Normal/Low",     "correlation_id": "UUID",     "reply_to": "QueueName"   } }`

**Protocol Specifications:**

- **Correlation ID:** Used to track request-response pairs.
- **Acknowledgments:**
    - Implement message acknowledgments to ensure reliable delivery.
- **Dead-Letter Queues:**
    - Handle undeliverable messages or processing failures.

**Code Example:**

python

Copy code

`import pika import uuid import json  class AgentCommunicator:     def __init__(self, agent_name):         self.agent_name = agent_name         self.connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))         self.channel = self.connection.channel()         self.queue_name = f"{agent_name}_queue"         self.channel.queue_declare(queue=self.queue_name)          def send_message(self, recipient, content, message_type, session_id, correlation_id=None):         message = {             "message_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),             "sender": self.agent_name,             "recipient": recipient,             "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),             "message_type": message_type,             "content": content,             "session_id": session_id,             "metadata": {                 "priority": "Normal",                 "correlation_id": correlation_id or str(uuid.uuid4()),                 "reply_to": self.queue_name             }         }         self.channel.basic_publish(             exchange='',             routing_key=f"{recipient}_queue",             body=json.dumps(message)         )          def start_listening(self, callback):         def on_message(channel, method, properties, body):             message = json.loads(body)             callback(message)             channel.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)                  self.channel.basic_consume(queue=self.queue_name, on_message_callback=on_message)         self.channel.start_consuming()`

---

#### **2.3 Handling Concurrency and Ordering**

- **Concurrency Control:**

    - Use locks or semaphores if necessary to manage shared resources.
    - Prefer stateless agent services to simplify concurrency management.
- **Message Ordering:**

    - Implement message sequence numbers if the order is critical.
    - Use the **correlation_id** and **message_id** to track message flows.

**DCE's Instructions:**

Building on our previous database design for the NovaSystem, we will now provide specific examples of database schemas, including SQL statements, and outline detailed work efforts related to the database implementation. Each work effort is broken down into sub-sections with unique IDs, facilitating precise tracking and management.

---

### **Database Schema Examples**

Below are SQL examples for the tables defined in our database design.

#### **1. Users Table**

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE users (     user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),     username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,     email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,     password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,     role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'admin', 'agent')),     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() );`

#### **2. Agents Table**

sql

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE agents (     agent_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),     name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('DCE', 'CAE', 'Arbiter', 'Magistrate', 'DomainExpert')),     status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive')),     config JSONB,     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() );`

#### **3. Sessions Table**

### **3. In-Depth Security Measures**

#### **3.1 Authentication Flow**

- **User Authentication:**

    - Users authenticate via login endpoint.
    - Upon successful login, a JWT access token is issued.
    - Access tokens have an expiration time (e.g., 1 hour).
- **Token Refresh Mechanism:**

    - Implement refresh tokens for obtaining new access tokens without re-authentication.
    - Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan (e.g., 30 days).

#### **3.2 Authorization**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

    - Define roles (`user`, `admin`, `agent`).
    - Assign permissions to roles.
    - Check permissions on each API endpoint.
- **Permission Checks:**

    - Use middleware to enforce authorization.
    - Deny access and return `403 Forbidden` if the user lacks necessary permissions.

#### **3.3 Data Protection**

- **Input Validation:**

    - Validate all incoming data using Pydantic models.
    - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Output Encoding:**

    - Escape or encode output data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Encryption:**

    - Use HTTPS for all client-server communication.
    - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

#### **3.4 Security Best Practices**

- **Secure Password Storage:**

    - Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) with salt.
    - Enforce password complexity requirements.
- **Preventing Common Attacks:**

    - Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations.
    - Use security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options).
- **Monitoring and Alerts:**

    - Monitor authentication attempts for suspicious activity.
    - Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts.

### **4. Detailed Data Flow and State Management**

#### **4.1 Data Flow Diagrams**

css

Copy code

`[User Action] --> [Front End UI] --> [API Gateway] --> [Controller] --> [Service] --> [Data Access Layer] --> [Database]`

- **User Action:** User interacts with the UI (e.g., clicks a button).
- **Front End UI:** Sends an HTTP request to the API Gateway.
- **API Gateway:** Authenticates the request and routes it to the appropriate controller.
- **Controller:** Processes the request, invokes services.
- **Service:** Contains business logic, may interact with agents or other services.
- **Data Access Layer:** Performs database operations via ORM.
- **Database:** Stores or retrieves data.

#### **4.2 Session Handling**

- **Session Creation:**

    - When a user starts a new session, a record is created in the `sessions` table.
    - Session ID is used to track subsequent interactions.
- **Session State:**

    - Session data is stored in the database.
    - Use in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed session data.
- **Session Termination:**

    - Sessions can be terminated by the user or after a period of inactivity.
    - Update the `status` and `ended_at` fields in the `sessions` table.

#### **4.3 State Management**

- **Stateless APIs:**

    - The middle layer APIs are stateless; session state is managed in the database or caching layer.
    - Each request contains all necessary information (e.g., tokens, session IDs).
- **Cache Management:**

    - Implement cache invalidation strategies.
    - Use cache for read-heavy data to improve performance.

#### **4.4 Message Processing**

- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous:**

    - Immediate responses are handled synchronously.
    - Long-running tasks (e.g., agent analysis) are processed asynchronously.
- **Task Queues:**

    - Use Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ as a message broker.
    - Tasks are enqueued, processed by worker processes, and results are stored.

    - Use appropriate status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error).
- **Exception Handling:**

    - Catch exceptions at different layers.
    - Log errors and avoid exposing sensitive information to the client.

#### **5.2 Logging**

- **Structured Logging:**

    - Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) for log entries.
    - Include contextual information (e.g., timestamps, user IDs, request IDs).
- **Log Levels:**

    - Define log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
    - Adjust logging verbosity based on the environment (development vs. production).
- **Centralized Logging:**

    - Use logging frameworks (e.g., Logstash, ELK Stack) to aggregate logs.
    - Facilitate log analysis and monitoring.

#### **5.3 Monitoring and Alerts**

- **Performance Metrics:**

    - Monitor API response times, error rates, throughput.
    - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time dashboards.
