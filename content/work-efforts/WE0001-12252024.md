I'll help you fill out this work effort document for the bytebrain project. Let me gather some information about the project first.

Ran tool


Let me check the README directly to get more context.

Read file: README.md


Based on the available information and the error message from your terminal, I'll fill out the work effort document:

# 💪 Work Effort • December 25, 2024

## 🎯 Project Overview
### Context
ByteBrain is a FastAPI-based application for benchmarking local Large Language Models (LLMs) via Ollama. The project aims to help users compare different models' performance, resource usage, and response quality.

### Objectives
- [ ] Fix current dependency issues preventing server startup
- [ ] Set up complete development environment
- [ ] Implement core benchmarking functionality
- [ ] Create user interface for running benchmarks and viewing results

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Application successfully starts and runs without errors
- [ ] Can benchmark multiple Ollama models in parallel
- [ ] Metrics collection (CPU, memory, GPU usage) working properly
- [ ] Results properly stored and retrievable

## 📋 Task Breakdown
### In Progress
- [ ] Resolving dependency issues (aiohttp missing)

### Completed
- [ ] Initial project structure setup
- [ ] Basic FastAPI application configuration

### Blocked
- [ ] Server startup blocked by missing aiohttp dependency

## 🛠️ Technical Details
### Implementation Notes
- FastAPI-based backend
- Ollama integration for LLM interaction
- MongoDB for data storage (with JSON fallback)

### Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- aiohttp (currently missing)
- MongoDB (optional)
- Ollama

### Environment Setup
- Local development environment needs configuration
- Missing dependencies need to be installed
- MongoDB setup required (optional)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
### Test Cases
- [ ] Test server startup
- [ ] Test Ollama connection
- [ ] Test benchmark execution
- [ ] Test results storage and retrieval

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Code linting
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Performance testing

### Review Points
- [ ] API endpoint functionality
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Resource management
- [ ] Data persistence

## 📊 Progress Tracking
### Time Spent
- Start Time: December 25, 2024, 13:25:03
- End Time: In progress
- Total Hours: Ongoing

### Milestones
- [ ] Fix dependency issues
- [ ] Complete environment setup
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Deploy initial version

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions
### Issues Encountered
- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiohttp'
- Server startup failing due to missing dependencies

### Solutions Applied
- Need to install required dependencies using Poetry or pip
- Need to verify all import paths are correct

### Open Questions
- MongoDB configuration details
- Deployment strategy
- Performance benchmarking criteria

## 📝 Documentation
### Code Changes
- Initial project setup
- Router configuration
- Service layer implementation

### Configuration Updates
- Need to set up environment variables
- Need to configure MongoDB connection

### Documentation Updates
- README.md present with installation and usage instructions
- Need to add API documentation
- Need to add deployment guide

## 🤝 Collaboration
### Team Members Involved
- Project owner/maintainer
- Contributors (to be determined)

### Communications
- GitHub repository for code collaboration
- Issue tracking for bug reports and feature requests

### Feedback Received
- Initial setup needs dependency resolution
- Documentation is comprehensive but needs implementation

## 📈 Results & Outcomes
### Achievements
- Project structure established
- Basic application framework in place
- Clear documentation of requirements and setup process

### Metrics
- To be determined once benchmarking is operational

### Next Steps
- [ ] Install missing aiohttp dependency
- [ ] Verify all other dependencies are properly installed
- [ ] Complete environment setup
- [ ] Begin implementing core benchmarking functionality
- [ ] Set up testing framework

Would you like me to help you resolve any of these specific issues, particularly the dependency problem that's preventing the server from starting?
