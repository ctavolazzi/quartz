The stage is set.

The players are at their places.

Am I truly ready?

Part of me feels like the 35 year old man I am today. I feel the full force and weight of who I've become.

And yet another part feels like a boy who still doesn't know who he wants to be when he grows up.

I have everything I need, and yet I feel wholly underprepared.

I guess you never really are truly "ready" you just do your best when the moment hits.

### And boy, did the moment hit.

I have 7 more hours in this Airbnb before I have to be back out on the street. I have two big priorities to use this money for:

## 1) Get my Gym Membership Back

I owe about $300 cuz I thought it was charging me but I guess it wasn't. I've been putting it off cuz I have been coding and I haven't been working out. Now my body shows it and I'm hurting all the time in ways that I just shouldn't be. It's time to get in the fucking gym and get healthy as shit. All you gotta do for the next 3 years or so is just not die.

> Just. Don't. Die.

That's literally it. That's the whole thing.

Cuz if you don't die, you're gonna watch robots take over every step of the entire supply chain and you'll feel the abundance that will come from that.

## Longevity Escape Velocity is on the horizon.
