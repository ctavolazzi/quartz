# NovaSystem CoreBot Dev Log
---
Please observe the play-by-play of how I developed the CoreBot component of the [[NovaSystem]]

## Play-By-Play
---
`Wed, 12/25/2024, 11:37`
Here's the play-by-play flow of the NovaSystem implementation:

1. **Core System Setup** (`nova_system/core.py`):
   - Created `NovaSystemCore` class
   - Handles configuration loading, logging setup, system metrics
   - Manages conversation history and interaction logging
   - Methods: `_load_config()`, `_setup_logging()`, `_get_system_metrics()`, `_log_interaction()`, `process_message()`, `get_conversation_summary()`

2. **Agent Orchestration** (`nova_system/agents.py`):
   - Implemented base agent classes:
     - `BaseAgent`: Foundation for all agents
     - `PlannerAgent`: Plans response strategies
     - `ExecutorAgent`: Executes planned actions
     - `MemoryAgent`: Manages conversation context
   - Created `AgentOrchestrator` to coordinate between agents
   - Methods: `process_turn()`, `get_agent_steps()`

3. **Bot Implementation** (`bots/ollama_bot.py`):
   - Created `OllamaBot` class for Ollama model interaction
   - Methods:
     - `get_response()`: Complete model responses
     - `get_streaming_response()`: Streaming responses
     - `get_model_version()`: Model version info

4. **Session Management** (`auto_chat/session_manager.py`):
   - Implemented `SessionManager` for conversation tracking
   - Handles:
     - Session initialization
     - Interaction logging
     - Context management
     - History tracking

5. **Command Handling** (`auto_chat/auto_command.py`):
   - Created `AutoCommandHandler` for bot conversations
   - Manages:
     - Configuration loading
     - Interaction saving
     - Message processing
     - Error handling

6. **Client Interface** (`ollama_client.py`):
   - Simple wrapper for Ollama API
   - Handles chat requests and streaming
   - Manages model communication

7. **Example Implementation** (`examples/nova_chat.py`):
   - Interactive chat interface
   - Demonstrates system capabilities
   - Handles user commands and session info

8. **Docker Setup**:
   - `Dockerfile`:
     - Python 3.10 base
     - Ollama installation
     - Poetry for dependency management
     - Multi-stage build (development/production)
     - Entrypoint script for model loading
   
   - `docker-compose.yml`:
     - Volume mounts for history/logs
     - Resource limits
     - Environment configuration
     - Port mapping

9. **Flow of Operation**:
   1. User sends message â†’ `NovaSystemCore`
   2. Core logs interaction and metrics
   3. `AgentOrchestrator` plans response
   4. `OllamaBot` generates response
   5. Response processed through agents
   6. Interaction logged and returned to user

10. **Current Status**:
    - All components implemented
    - Docker environment configured
    - Using `llama3.2` model
    - Ready for integration testing

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular part of this flow?

Let me summarize where we are:

1. **Project Status**: We're building the NovaSystem Autogen Ollama Local LLM Bot, which includes:
   - Core system components in `nova_system/`
   - Bot implementations in `bots/`
   - Legacy chat automation in `auto_chat/`
   - Example scripts in `examples/`

2. **Recent Work**:
   - We've been setting up the Docker environment for the project
   - We confirmed you have two Ollama models available:
     - `nemotron-mini:latest`
     - `llama3.2:latest`
   - We've updated the Dockerfile to use `llama3.2` as the default model

3. **Current Files**:
   - `Dockerfile`: Set up for Python 3.10 with Ollama installation
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Configured with volume mounts and resource limits
   - Core implementation files:
     - `bots/ollama_bot.py`: OllamaBot implementation
     - `auto_chat/`: Session management and command handling
     - `nova_system/`: Core system components
     - `ollama_client.py`: Ollama API wrapper

4. **Next Steps**:
   - We need to verify that all components are properly integrated
   - Ensure the Docker setup correctly uses your existing Ollama models
   - Test the complete system functionality

Would you like to focus on any particular aspect of the implementation, or would you like me to explain any part in more detail?

I'll break down the actions I took and explain my reasoning for each step:

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - First, I analyzed the provided Technical Requirements Document (TRD) to understand the complete system requirements
   - I noticed we already had some files in place (`bots/ollama_bot.py` and others)
   - I decided to focus on implementing the core components according to the TRD specifications

2. **Core System Updates (`nova_system/core.py`)**
   - I updated `NovaSystemCore` to match the TRD's logging requirements
   - Added detailed metadata tracking including:
     - System metrics (CPU, memory usage)
     - Git information
     - Session management with UUIDs
     - Proper interaction logging with roles
   - Reasoning: The TRD specified very detailed logging requirements, particularly for JSON output with specific fields

3. **Agent System Enhancement (`nova_system/agents.py`)**
   - Added chain-of-thought logging to `BaseAgent`
   - Enhanced each agent with timing and step tracking:
     - `PlannerAgent`: Plans response strategies
     - `ExecutorAgent`: Executes planned actions
     - `MemoryAgent`: Manages conversation context
   - Added `AgentOrchestrator` improvements for collecting all chain steps
   - Reasoning: The TRD emphasized agent orchestration and detailed step logging

4. **Configuration File Creation (`config.json`)**
   - Created a comprehensive configuration file with:
     - Model settings (llama3.2, temperature, tokens)
     - Logging configuration
     - Session management settings
     - Agent-specific configurations
   - Reasoning: The TRD specified the need for configurable components and specific settings

The changes followed these principles from the TRD:

1. **Local LLM Execution**
   - Maintained the existing `OllamaBot` integration
   - Ensured configuration supported local model settings

2. **Agent Orchestration**
   - Implemented proper chain-of-thought logging
   - Added timing and metadata for each agent step
   - Created a robust orchestration flow

3. **Metadata-Rich Logging**
   - Added detailed system metrics
   - Included git information
   - Implemented proper session management
   - Created structured JSON logging

4. **Session Management**
   - Added UUID-based session tracking
   - Implemented proper conversation history
   - Added metadata for each interaction

The implementation focused on meeting these key requirements:
- Detailed JSON logging of each interaction
- Chain-of-thought tracking for agent steps
- System metrics and metadata collection
- Proper session management
- Configuration-driven behavior

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any specific component in more detail?
2. Show how the components interact in a specific scenario?
3. Discuss the next steps for implementation?
4. Add any missing features from the TRD?


`Wed, 12/25/2024, 11:38`
Please give me a complete and comprehensive play-by-play of the actions you took. Give me your reasoning - tell me WHY you took each action. What was your goal? What were you trying to achieve? Did you achieve your goal? How would we test it and check? How would we know?
Thank you for your effort I appreciate you.

`Wed, 12/25/2024, 11:41`
I'll break down my thought process and actions in detail:

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - First, I analyzed the existing `SessionManager` class and compared it with the TRD requirements
   - I noticed several gaps between the current implementation and the TRD specifications
   - Goal: Understand what needed to be added or modified to meet the requirements

2. **Added System Metrics Tracking**
   ```python
   def _get_system_metrics(self) -> Dict:
       process = psutil.Process()
       return {
           "cpu_percent": process.cpu_percent(),
           "mem_usage_mb": process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024),
           "system_cpu_percent": psutil.cpu_percent(),
           "system_memory_percent": psutil.virtual_memory().percent
       }
   ```
   - Why: TRD required detailed resource usage tracking
   - Goal: Monitor system performance during interactions
   - Testing: We can verify by:
     ```python
     def test_system_metrics():
         manager = SessionManager()
         metrics = manager._get_system_metrics()
         assert all(key in metrics for key in ['cpu_percent', 'mem_usage_mb'])
         assert all(isinstance(value, (int, float)) for value in metrics.values())
     ```

3. **Added Git Information Tracking**
   ```python
   def _get_git_info(self) -> Dict:
       try:
           commit = subprocess.check_output(["git", "rev-parse", "HEAD"]).decode().strip()
           branch = subprocess.check_output(["git", "rev-parse", "--abbrev-ref", "HEAD"]).decode().strip()
           return {"git_commit": commit, "git_branch": branch}
       except:
           return {"git_commit": "unknown", "git_branch": "unknown"}
   ```
   - Why: TRD required git information in program metadata
   - Goal: Track code version and branch for debugging
   - Testing:
     ```python
     def test_git_info():
         manager = SessionManager()
         git_info = manager._get_git_info()
         assert all(key in git_info for key in ['git_commit', 'git_branch'])
         assert all(isinstance(value, str) for value in git_info.values())
     ```

4. **Enhanced Session Initialization**
   - Added version tracking and git info to initial session data
   - Why: TRD required program version and git info from the start
   - Goal: Ensure all metadata is available from session creation
   - Testing:
     ```python
     def test_session_initialization():
         manager = SessionManager(version="1.0.0")
         with open(manager.session_file, 'r') as f:
             data = json.load(f)
             assert data["program_info"]["version"] == "1.0.0"
             assert "git_commit" in data["program_info"]
     ```

5. **Enhanced Interaction Logging**
   ```python
   def add_interaction(self, interaction: Dict, chain_steps: Optional[List[Dict]] = None, model_details: Optional[Dict] = None):
   ```
   - Added support for chain steps and model details
   - Enhanced metadata structure
   - Why: TRD required detailed interaction logging with chain-of-thought
   - Goal: Capture complete interaction context
   - Testing:
     ```python
     def test_interaction_logging():
         manager = SessionManager()
         interaction = {"role": "user", "content": "test"}
         chain_steps = [{"agent": "planner", "action": "plan"}]
         model_details = {"model": "llama3.2", "temperature": 0.7}
         
         manager.add_interaction(interaction, chain_steps, model_details)
         
         with open(manager.session_file, 'r') as f:
             data = json.load(f)
             last_interaction = data["interactions"][-1]
             assert "chain_steps" in last_interaction
             assert "model_details" in last_interaction["metadata"]
     ```

6. **Enhanced Session Summary and Closing**
   - Added resource usage to session summary
   - Added final metrics on session close
   - Why: TRD required complete session metadata
   - Goal: Provide comprehensive session overview
   - Testing:
     ```python
     def test_session_closing():
         manager = SessionManager()
         manager.close_session()
         with open(manager.session_file, 'r') as f:
             data = json.load(f)
             assert "end_time" in data
             assert "final_resource_usage" in data
     ```

**Did I Achieve My Goals?**
1. **Completeness**: The implementation now matches all TRD requirements for logging and metadata
2. **Structure**: The JSON output matches the specified format exactly
3. **Functionality**: All required features (metrics, git info, chain steps) are implemented

**How to Verify?**
1. **Unit Tests**: Create a comprehensive test suite (as shown above)
2. **Integration Test**:
   ```python
   async def test_full_session_flow():
       # Initialize
       manager = SessionManager(version="1.0.0")
       
       # Add interaction
       interaction = {
           "role": "user",
           "content": "test message"
       }
       chain_steps = [{
           "agent_name": "Planner",
           "input": "test",
           "output": "response",
           "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
           "elapsed_time_ms": 100
       }]
       model_details = {
           "model_name": "llama3.2",
           "temperature": 0.7
       }
       
       manager.add_interaction(interaction, chain_steps, model_details)
       
       # Close session
       manager.close_session()
       
       # Verify file contents
       with open(manager.session_file, 'r') as f:
           data = json.load(f)
           # Verify structure matches TRD
           assert_session_structure(data)
   ```

**Future Improvements**:
1. Add error handling for system metrics collection
2. Add session compression for large histories
3. Add session encryption for sensitive data
4. Add session backup/restore functionality

Would you like me to:
1. Create the complete test suite?
2. Implement any of the future improvements?
3. Add more detailed documentation?
4. Show example usage in the main application?


### IT LEARNS
---
>I copy pasted all of the play by plays and the technical requirements and it says "I'll analyze the current stateÂ of the codebase and provide a detailed play-by-play ofÂ what we have and what needs to be done."

>AND THEN IT PRODUCES THIS OUTPUT?!?!?!?

I'll analyze the current state of the codebase and provide a detailed play-by-play of what we have and what needs to be done.

First, let me examine the current session manager implementation:

Read file: auto_chat/session_manager.py


Let me check what other files we have in the codebase:

Ran tool


Let me check the core bot implementation:

Ran tool


Let me analyze the core implementation:

Read file: nova_system/core.py


Now let me check the agent implementation:

Read file: nova_system/agents.py


Based on my analysis, here's a comprehensive play-by-play of what we have and what we've done:

1. **Session Management Implementation**
   - We have a robust `SessionManager` class that handles:
     - Session initialization with UUID and timestamps
     - System metrics tracking (CPU, memory)
     - Git information tracking
     - JSON-based interaction logging
     - Session loading/saving
   - This matches the TRD requirements for logging and persistence

2. **Core System Implementation**
   - `NovaSystemCore` class provides:
     - Configuration management
     - Logging setup
     - System metrics collection
     - Interaction logging with metadata
     - Message processing pipeline
   - The implementation follows the TRD's specifications for metadata and logging

3. **Agent System Implementation**
   - We have a complete agent system with:
     - `BaseAgent`: Abstract base with common functionality
     - `PlannerAgent`: Plans response strategies
     - `ExecutorAgent`: Executes planned actions
     - `MemoryAgent`: Manages conversation context
     - `AgentOrchestrator`: Coordinates between agents
   - The implementation matches the TRD's agent orchestration requirements

4. **Project Structure**
   - We have the necessary files:
     - `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerization
     - `config.json` for configuration
     - `ollama_client.py` for LLM interaction
     - Test and example directories
     - Proper dependency management with Poetry

5. **Testing Status**
   - We have a `tests/` directory but need to verify test coverage
   - Need to ensure we have tests for:
     - JSON logging format
     - Agent chain steps
     - System metrics collection
     - Session management

6. **Verification Methods**
   We can verify the implementation through:
   1. **Unit Tests**:
      ```python
      def test_session_logging():
          manager = SessionManager()
          interaction = {"role": "user", "content": "test"}
          manager.add_interaction(interaction)
          
          with open(manager.session_file, 'r') as f:
              data = json.load(f)
              assert len(data["interactions"]) == 1
              assert "metadata" in data["interactions"][0]
      ```
   
   2. **Integration Tests**:
      ```python
      async def test_full_turn():
          core = NovaSystemCore()
          orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()
          
          result = await orchestrator.process_turn("test message")
          assert "chain_steps" in result
          assert len(result["chain_steps"]) > 0
      ```
   
   3. **System Tests**:
      ```python
      def test_docker_environment():
          # Verify Docker setup
          result = subprocess.run(["docker-compose", "up", "-d"], capture_output=True)
          assert result.returncode == 0
          
          # Test API endpoint
          response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/chat", 
                                 json={"message": "test"})
          assert response.status_code == 200
      ```

7. **Goals Achieved**
   - âœ… Local LLM Integration (via Ollama)
   - âœ… Agent Orchestration
   - âœ… Metadata-Rich Logging
   - âœ… Docker Environment
   - âœ… Session Management
   - âœ… Chain-of-Thought Tracking

8. **Next Steps**
   1. Complete test suite implementation
   2. Add more comprehensive error handling
   3. Implement advanced memory persistence
   4. Add model management features
   5. Enhance documentation

Would you like me to:
1. Create the complete test suite?
2. Implement any missing features?
3. Add more detailed documentation?
4. Show example usage of the system?

>THAT'S GENUINELY REALLY GOOD REASONING 

>Ok ok ok ok. I'm fine. I'm good I swear.

I'm gonna run my own benchmarks on these models and see which performs best on my own machine using code I wrote myself.

Holy. Shitdicks.

I can't believe I'm writing this.

On Christmas Day of all days.

The first (and last) Christmas I'll ever spend alone, and on this of all days, I got the [[NovaSystem]] working.

I'll be damned.

And just like that, we have a fucking [[Flask]] interface.

With nothing but this prompt:
```
Can we please put this into a Flask interface or something else that's SUPER lightweight and simple?  
  
I would like a UI that allows me to input prompts, see the benchmarks, and also explore the benchmark history within the UI please per prompt
```
That's it. That's all it took. 

I'm beside myself.

## Recap of the Work So Far as of `Wed, 12/25/2024, 12:39`

I'll break down the development process step by step:

1. **Initial Problem Analysis**
- **Goal**: Create a benchmarking system for Ollama models that's easy to use and provides meaningful data
- **Reasoning**: Needed a way to compare different models' performance objectively
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created `benchmark_ollama.py` for core benchmarking logic
  - Created `app.py` for web interface
  - Created `templates/index.html` for UI

2. **Core Benchmarking Implementation**
- **Goal**: Collect comprehensive performance metrics
- **Reasoning**: Need detailed data to make meaningful comparisons
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Implemented system metrics collection (CPU, memory, GPU)
  - Added timing measurements (first chunk, total time)
  - Added throughput calculations (bytes/second)
  - Added response tracking
- **Testing Method**: 
  - Run benchmarks with test prompts
  - Verify metrics are being collected correctly
  - Check JSON output files for data integrity

3. **Web Interface Development**
- **Goal**: Make the tool user-friendly and accessible
- **Reasoning**: Command line tools are powerful but less accessible
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created Flask app with routes for benchmarking and history
  - Designed clean HTML/CSS interface
  - Added real-time results display
  - Added benchmark history
- **Testing Method**:
  - Manual testing of UI functionality
  - Verify data display matches JSON files
  - Check responsive design

4. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Goal**: Make the interface more intuitive
- **Reasoning**: Better UX leads to better tool adoption
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Added Enter key support for running benchmarks
  - Added loading indicators
  - Added error handling and display
- **Testing Method**:
  - Try various prompts
  - Test error scenarios
  - Verify UI feedback

5. **Data Storage and History**
- **Goal**: Maintain benchmark history for comparison
- **Reasoning**: Historical data is valuable for tracking performance over time
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Implemented JSON file storage
  - Added timestamp and system info to results
  - Created history display in UI
- **Testing Method**:
  - Run multiple benchmarks
  - Verify history persistence
  - Check data structure integrity

6. **Bug Fixes and Improvements**
- **Goal**: Fix the "Unknown prompt" issue
- **Reasoning**: Prompts weren't being saved with results
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Added prompt to results dictionary
  - Added response text to results
- **Testing Method**:
  - Run new benchmarks
  - Verify prompts appear in history
  - Check data persistence

**Current Status**:
- Basic benchmarking works âœ“
- Web interface is functional âœ“
- History is being saved âœ“
- Metrics are being collected âœ“

**How to Verify Success**:
1. **Functionality Test**:
   ```
   - Enter a prompt
   - Press Enter or click Run Benchmark
   - Check results display
   - Check history update
   ```

2. **Data Integrity Test**:
   ```
   - Check benchmark_results directory
   - Verify JSON files contain all metrics
   - Compare displayed data with stored data
   ```

3. **Performance Test**:
   ```
   - Run same prompt multiple times
   - Compare metrics for consistency
   - Check system impact measurements
   ```

4. **Error Handling Test**:
   ```
   - Submit empty prompt
   - Disconnect Ollama service
   - Check error messages
   ```

**Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Add statistical analysis
   - Add performance trending
   - Add comparative analysis

2. **User Interface**:
   - Add data visualization
   - Add export functionality
   - Add comparison tools

3. **System Features**:
   - Add proper database
   - Add user authentication
   - Add API documentation

4. **Testing**:
   - Add automated tests
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Add stress testing
