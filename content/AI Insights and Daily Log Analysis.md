## What is this?
This document captures key insights about AI development and Knowledge Garden architecture, analyzing the structure and implementation of our documentation system. It serves as a bridge between daily logs and structured knowledge management.

## Main Ideas
- Knowledge Garden implements a three-layer architecture
- Documentation follows consistent templating and structure
- AI integration supports knowledge management
- System designed for scalability and maintainability

## Key Insights

### Architecture Overview
- Content Layer for knowledge organization
- Technical Layer for implementation
- Distribution Layer for sharing and access
- Integration between layers creates cohesive system

### Documentation System
