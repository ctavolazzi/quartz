## The Scoop ‚ú®

Hey! Trying to wrap your head around AI? Same here! That's why we get together Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday mornings at 8am PST for coffee and chat about all things AI. Come to one, two, or all three - the more the merrier!

Whether you're curious about how AI is changing the future of work, looking for practical ways to leverage these tools, or just want to share your latest "wow, AI helped me do this!" moment - there's space for all of it here.

No agenda. No pressure. Just real people sharing real experiences over virtual coffee.

> [!tip] Pro Tip
> Many participants find that each day has its own unique vibe and community. Try different days to find your favorite rhythm!

## What's It Like? üåü

Picture this: You're in your comfy clothes, favorite drink in hand, hanging out with fellow [[Tech Explorers|tech explorers]] who are all trying to navigate the AI landscape. Some days we dive deep into tech, other days we just laugh about our [[AI Fails|ai fails]]. It's all good!

One person shares how they're using AI to streamline their work, another mentions a cool way they're using it to help their kids learn, and someone else brings up the latest AI news for discussion. Every session is different, but always valuable.
