Daily Note
This is going to become something grand, I can already feel it
I have all the skills necessary to begin this next block of work - building a robot gardener is the next goal and it is right on the horizon. I'm ready, it's time, let's fucking do this!

I'm going to work on building robot gardeners with Johnny Autoseed, and I'm starting the real process today.
I can build my notes on aiecotech.org and then point an AI LLM at the site and it will know what I know.
I can use the Obsidian app on my computer to edit the text files in this Github repo I made to host Quartz, and by doing that I can use a familiar and robust and secure and stable system, Obsidian, to make my notes, record my thoughts, and make them available to the world and to every AI in it, and by doing so increase my chances and my opportunities, while simultaneously keeping myself safe from bullshit.

This is the beginning. 

It starts today.
